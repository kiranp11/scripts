Besides using the technique to bomb different places in Indonesia, JI ? which aims to establish Islamic state in southeast Asia ? has also exported it to Philippines where terrorists have used it effectively in a number of incidents.Referring to the technique being put to use in India, intelligence officials said some local terrorists could have visited Indonesia for training via Bangladesh ? a fact which the Special Task Force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh police had first got wind of during interrogation of Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) operatives last year.\"Links of LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) with Al Qaida is not a secret, and this leads to strong possibility of linkages of their Indian modules with JI in southeast Asia,\" said an official, adding that the IC explosive device ? similar to the ones used by JI ? found in Bangalore and Surat had only confirmed the suspicion.While the jehadis were successful in their first attempt to use IC explosive devices in Bangalore on July 25, they could not make a similar impact three days later in Surat, where the chips used in the bombs had some fault.None of the bombs in Surat exploded, averting another disaster. \"It indicates origin of consignments from two different places for Bangalore and Surat ? even though it could be the handiwork of a single group using different terror modules,\" said a senior official of the National Security Guard (NSG) which has sent its forensic experts to Gujarat.The bombs in Ahmedabad were, however, of a different make. Timer devices were used there and the design was strikingly similar to those used to bomb courts in three UP cities ? Varanasi, Faizabad and Lucknow ? in November last year and in Jaipur on May 13 this year. Incidentally, a group calling itself Indian Mujahideen claimed responsibility for all three attacks by sending emails to media organisations prior to the blasts.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

While some reforms do not require legislative support, those which do are going to run into a Left-BJP phalanx.This will be yet another instance of Left and BJP being on the same side, even though for different reasons. The Left veto had blocked the reforms while the comrades were outside supporters of the government. But BJP has been stung by UPA successfully poaching eight of its MPs in the recently concluded trust vote in Lok Sabha.While the BJP has offered the political argument that UPA\'s majority in Parliament had been \"manufactured\" and was \"illegal\", the bitterness generated by the vote seems to have put paid to any cooperation even though the saffronites are not opposed to the proposed liberalisation measures. In fact, some of these initiatives had been taken up by the NDA itself.If the Left and NDA decide to make a fight of it, the government would have to be very careful of its numbers. With the help of defectors it was able to notch up 275, but the margin slim could reduce further if MPs who cross-voted are disqualified. The thin numbers will make piloting sensitive legislation risky as if a bill were to fall, the opposition is bound to call for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\'s resignation.The reform measures that have been lying in cold storage are seen to be important for infrastructure development and unlocking funds needed for long-term investments. Given its ideological orientation and trade union interests, Left had blocked many of these.The NDA decision is at odds with its criticism of UPA for having buckled under Left pressure.Unlike its stand on the women\'s reservation bill, where it has said it will support the government, BJP has opted for all out confrontation when it comes to economic reforms. The Opposition alliance has been smarting from the relative ease with which UPA and its new ally SP were able to get MPs to cross vote and the exchanges between the PM and Leader of Opposition L K Advani have barely been civil.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

The serialised expansion is being contemplated as the Centre is finding it hard to accommodate a demanding Samajwadi Party alongside Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.JMM chief Shibu Soren is not willing to wait much for the coal ministry after he sided with UPA in the trust vote. His reinduction in the Union cabinet was a key demand in the pre-trust vote negotiations when Congress strained every nerve to woo Soren who was being wooed as vigorously by BJP.The tribal leader\'s impatience has takers in Congress leadership which feels that he cannot be kept out in this critical juncture when it would mean like sending him in the waiting arms of NDA. While the fear of another trust vote in Parliament would hang permanently in the event of Left\'s exit from ruling combine, Congress is keeping in mind the Lok Sabha elections where JMM would be a key ally in deciding the poll fortunes.Congress, however, may require more time to accommodate SP which has not only sought key cabinet berths but also linked its joining the central government to the firming up of a seat-sharing arrangement with Congress in Uttar Pradesh.The PM would take a call on the issue after his return from the weekend SAARC summit in Colombo. It is not clear if the Congress would have found a way of accommodating the two partners so soon. If it does not, then JMM would be in the cabinet and SP could be part of another expansion. SP general secretary Amar Singh, Akhilesh Yadav, son of party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav, and Rasheed Masood are candidates cleared for the cream of the cabinet share. The party has not made any clear-cut demands but Congress realises that it would have to be what are viewed as \"coveted cabinet berths\".As is understood from SP\'s compulsions, these ministries would have to match the political profile which would give its leaders not merely a place in the protocol but also have a popular echo and stoke enthusiasm among its demoralised cadre. It is seen as a bid to rejuvenate the partymen who are still to get over the decimation in May 2007 at the hands of BSP supremo Mayawati. Congress quarters feel it may require time to make adequate space for SP which it concedes played a key role in fulfilling the leadership\'s wish of rescuing the government and the nuclear deal without the Left bloc.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

Terrorists used this vehicle extensively for travel between Ahmedabad and Vadodara, as per expressway records.It is possible that the bombers used Vadodara as the base for making bombs and also travelled to Surat in the vehicle during the period.The car used in the Civil Hospital blast had a fake registration number GJ 6D 9778 of a Vadodara two-wheeler. Inquiries revealed that the first record of the car\'s movement was at the Vadodara toll plaza at 3 pm on July 3, indicating that it was headed for Ahmedabad.Subsequently, movements of the car are recorded on July 7, 8, 9, 23 and 24. Police believe the bombs may have been brought to Ahmedabad just two days before the blasts.On July 26, the car packed with IEDs and LPG gas cylinders became the spearhead of the terrorist operation, accounting for nearly two-third of the total casualties in Ahmedabad.July 3 Vadodara to AhmedabadJuly 7 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 8 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 9 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 23 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-AhmedabadJuly 24 Ahmedabad-Vadodara-Ahmedabad\nMovement of the car bomb along Expressway\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

Airing the tapes at this stage would be drawing inferences, and the story was not cast-iron as of now, the channel claimed, quoting Salve. The channel said that the sting had \"too many loose ends that needed to be cross-checked, corroborated and investigated further before the story could be aired\". On Sunday, BJP leader L K Advani had criticised the channel for not airing the tapes, calling it \"mysterious self-censorship\" by a media house.L K Advani had, in a letter to Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, demanded that the CDs be made public without any delay to enable people to come to a well-informed and fair conclusion. \"People\'s right to information cannot be circumscribed in any manner,\" he had said, adding that the investigation material pertaining to the \"whistle-blowing operation\" could not be treated as the \"private property\" of the channel.Responding to Advani\'s allegation that there was a time-lag of 24 hours before the footage was provided to the Speaker, the channel said that all the raw, unedited footage had been given to the Speaker and not a single frame had been edited in any form. Citing the petition of the three BJP MPs before the Speaker, Advani had said, \"They have affirmed that CNN-IBN agreed to work with them in investigating the matter and sent a team that actually recorded almost the entire trail of the bribery operation.The channel had assured the whistle-blowers that the recorded tape would be telecast soon. However, this was not done. In any democracy, it would be a gross impropriety if the whistle-blowers are let down by the media organisation that conducted the investigation.\" Meanwhile, the Speaker has clarified that he had not imposed any restrictions on the airing of the tapes and that the decision was entirely the channel\'s.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

The Centre\'s fresh decision, sure to deflect the adverse publicity attracted by the Congress-led UPA government on Ram Sethu, appears to counter the consistent stand of the southern ally\'s singular approach to fast-track the project, which PM had inaugurated in 2005.The six-member panel, headed by Rajendra Pachauri will \"quickly examine the feasibility of alternative alignment suggested by the SC for the Sethusamudram shipping channel project between Dhanuskodi and Lands-End on Rameshwaram Island keeping in view the technical aspects, cost benefit analysis, social and cultural impact, environmental impact, law and order aspect and any other related matters\", the Centre said.Importantly, the government has not fixed any time-frame for submission of the report by the committee except for giving it an elastic schedule of \"submit report as quickly as possible\".Given the enormity of the task, for example, assessing the cultural and law and order impact, which directly involves assessing the \"faith\" element linked to the Ram Sethu, it is unlikely that the committee could firm up its view and submit a report in the next few months, and possibly till the general elections.As a face-saving measure for the DMK, the Centre included principal secretary (environment and forests) to the government of Tamil Nadu Dr N Sundaradevan and Ramanathapuram district collector R Kirtoshkumar as special invitees.\nNo time limit for panel to give report\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

It isn\'t hard to find blast suspect Imran Malik\'s house located near Paith Ka Chabutra mohalla. It\'s small quarter painted in yellow with three tiny rooms.According to his mother, Saijan, Imran is 18 years old ? other residents say he is a few years older ? and had dropped out of school a few years back. The son of a hawker of clothes, Imran was learning how to become a professional faith healer, one who wards off evil spirits by offering prayers and tabij (amulets) for a fee.\"For the past six months, he used to visit Delhi to learn the art. The last time he left was a fortnight ago,\" she says. But she doesn\'t say where he stayed or how he reached Udaipur. \"He had rented a house in Delhi for sometime. Then he left it,\" is all she says.Then she breaks down, \"My son is innocent. Ask anybody in the locality. He is a simple boy.\" Since the Ahmedabad serial blasts, the local intelligence is in a tizzy. They have been asked to find out if Abdul Halim, a Godhra accused who was arrested after the blasts, has any links with Pilkhuwa, a larger kasbah located 15km away from Dhaulana.\"We have been unable to find anything that links Halim to Pilkhuwa,\" says a local intelligence unit (LIU) official. About 20 years ago, Pilkhuwa was famous for its canvas manufacturing factories. Since the world has shifted to plastic, most of those factories have shut shop.What remains are its printing and dyeing units. Shops located by the NH 24 still display printed bedsheets and towels, with a smiling Harry Potter or a pouting Barbie. Local journalists say many of these units are illegal. But Pilkhuwa, located in Uttar Pradesh\'s Ghaziabad district, became notorious when it turned out to be the home of Abdul Kareem, a terrorist who had specialized in making bombs and who lost one of his hands to a blast ? earning him the nickname, Tunda.

He has been a guerrilla for nearly three decades, except for a stint as a government minister. He is an Islamic scholar, equally comfortable firing shoulder-fired Stingers and negotiating with American or Saudi paymasters.Meet Maulana Jalaluddin Haqqani, 60, recognized as the emerging leader of a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. Haqqani made his name in the jihad against the communists in Afghanistan much before the Taliban emerged out of Kandahar. He was credited with the first ever victory against the Najibullah government in 1991 when his Pashtun fighters dramatically seized the town of Khost, in eastern Afghanistan.His extensive contacts in Saudi Arabia helped him mobilize huge funds for the war. In those days, Haqqani reportedly had the largest hoard of weaponry received from the US. This was the time when he forged links with the ISI of Pakistan, which was deeply involved in the anti-Soviet war. Such was his legend both as a scholar and as a strategic military commander, that the Taliban offered him a ministership in their government in Kabul.After the US attacked Afghanistan in 2001, Haqqani was relentlessly pursued by US bombing raids in western Afghanistan. He escaped unhurt to Miram Shah in Waziristan, western Pakistan. From there arose the dreaded Haqqani Network ? a secretive, loosely-knit organization of fighters carrying out armed raids and suicide bombings in Afghanistan, and if need be, in Pakistan. His old ISI connections have helped him retain the safe haven in Pakistan. One of his sons, Sirajuddin, known as Khalifa, has also emerged as a leader of this network.In recent years, as Haqqani\'s influence has grown, he challenged Mullah Omar, openly ridiculing him as an illiterate. This led to several overtures being made by the US to win him over to their side. However, all the efforts failed, as Haqqani vowed to continue the jihad. Haqqani is once again in the thick of the fight, but this time he may well emerge as the new leader of the Taliban.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

Now, voices from inside the IITs are beginning to question the JEE format. The director and the dean of IIT-Madras have called for radical changes in the JEE, saying that the coaching institutes were enabling many among the less-than-best students to crack the test and keeping girls from qualifying.\"I am looking for students with raw intelligence and not those with a mind prepared by coaching class tutors. The coaching classes only help students in mastering (question paper) pattern recognizing skills. With this, you cannot get students with raw intelligence,\" said IIT-Madras director, M S Ananth.Virtually opening what could be a heated debate on the current JEE format, Ananth wanted the system to lay more stress on students\' performance in school. \"You may not be able to do away with the JEE but I am wondering if we should be conducting an examination for 3,00,00 aspirants and selecting just 5,000. Instead, we must evolve a system where only the top 1% of students from different state boards and CBSE are permitted to appear for the JEE,\" he said.Professor V G Idichandy, dean (students), IIT Madras, was more vocal, demanding that JEE be abolished. \"One of the reasons for the poor intake of girls in the flagship BTech programme is that parents don\'t send daughters for coaching classes. The best way to increase the intake of girls is to have direct admissions,\" he said.Both Ananth and Idichandy expressed concern that the present system did not allow for the 12 years of schooling to have a bearing on admissions into IITs. \"The overall capability of a student cannot be merely assessed by their performance in physics, mathematics and chemistry. The student must have good communication skills also,\" Idichandy said.IIT-Madras director, M S Ananth said, by attending the IIT coaching classes, students were learning a wrong lesson that the ends justify the means. \"They (students) think there is nothing wrong in missing school to attend coaching. But the student does not realize his real loss.\"Ananth recalled that three years ago, a JEE review committee had suggested a cut-off of 85% marks in the Class XII board exam for students to be eligible for the JEE. \"But the CBSE and other boards turned it down and wanted to have 60% as the cut-off. Now, that\'s an easy score to get,\" he said.While acknowledging that the JEE has led to proliferation of coaching classes and has put students under stress, IIT-Bombay director, Ashok Misra, was more cautious on bringing in wholesale changes. \"If we can develop another system that is not overhyped, I am for it. But doing away with the JEE does not seem appropriate at present. We have been constantly working on tweaking the JEE as per the students\' needs and also to cut down on pressure,\" he said. Evidently, we haven\'t heard the last word on this issue.\n\'Need to revamp JEE\'\n(With inputs from Hemali Chhapia in Mumbai)\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

According to other member states, Germany has floated August 21 as a possible date for the plenary meeting.In another development, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and US undersecretary William Burns are talking to each other on the phone to bridge the differences on the US draft for the exemption. It was clear from the beginning that the exemption would have to mirror the spirit of the July 18, 2005 joint statement and the 123 agreement ? which obviously meant that there couldn\'t be any references to nuclear testing by India. The US draft is a short one, barely over a page long.India\'s worries are that even after an NSG waiver, it will be a while before it becomes a member of the suppliers group. Until then, India doesn\'t want to be dictated to by the suppliers group on amendments to the guidelines, nor does it want to be left out of the decision-making process. This means if the NSG amends its guidelines, as it apparently does, India wants to be in on the action, rather than be told about it, which would make India a sort of a \"junior partner\". The struggle is to give India the kind of comfort it needs before it can legitimately become a member of the group.Indian government sources say there are other differences in the language that\'s been presented. However, officials said, \"We\'ve gone too far for the other side to be unaware of what we want.\" India believes the exemption has to strike a fine balance that will help nuclear commerce not hinder it.Senior government sources were also optimistic that the differences would be cleared by August 1. There is also a feeling that after clearing much tougher hurdles in negotiating the 123 agreement, these differences would be more manageable. Germany now becomes the centre of action and sources said, German chancellor Angela Merkel has been very proactive on the NSG front. \"They\'re doing fantastic work,\" the sources said.Essentially, the core of the NSG waiver will be political, not technical. Therefore, there is little appetite for having another technical level meeting before the plenary. Some members may ask for a separate briefing, which will be given, much like the July 25 technical briefing for IAEA members. The US has left Germany and France to bring around the sceptics in Europe.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

As per the CPM constitution, party members earning Rs 8,000 or more a month have to pay 5% as levy to the party. Chatterjee\'s levy was also received in the month of July.Party sources also confirmed on Wednesday that throughout his stint as Speaker, Chatterjee took the help of party cadre to carry out development works in Bolpur, his Lok Sabha constituency.A senior party leader said, \"We only removed him from the party. He can continue to occupy the Speaker\'s post if he wants. We are not even going to press for his disqualification as MP. A section of the party in Bengal is not happy with the decision but disciplinary action had to be taken. He is there because the party decided to have him as Speaker. It is a correct decision and ultimately the party cadre would appreciate it.\"While maintaining that Chatterjee is free to approach the CPM\'s Control Commission against his expulsion, a senior leader said, \"I doubt he would do that. He must be feeling liberated now.\"Party sources also denied that any formula has been devised by party veteran Jyoti Basu. According to the formula, Chatterjee would resign from the Speaker\'s post in August and then go to the Control Commission seeking redressal of his expulsion.\"There is no such formula by Jyoti Basu or anyone.

And if they want to give civilian nuclear status to India, we would also expect the same for Pakistan too\".\"For us, national security is supreme and the government will do everything in its power to defend it,\" says Mohammed Sadiq, spokesperson, Pakistan Foreign Office.Meanwhile, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), US has confronted Pakistan with new evidence about ties between the country\'s spy service with some militant groups responsible for rising violence in Afghanistan, possibly including suicide bombing at the Indian embassy in Kabul earlier this month.A top official of CIA secretly travelled to Islamabad this month and confronted Pakistan\'s senior officials with new information about deepening ties between the ISI and the militants operating in tribal areas, the New York Times said quoting American military and intelligence officials.CIA\'s deputy director Stephen R Kappes? secret visit to Pakistan on July 12, along with Adm Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff, was described by several American military and intelligence officials in interviews to the daily, who made it clear that they welcomed the decision by the CIA to take a harder line toward the ISI\'s dealings with militant groups.The meetings took place days after a suicide bomber attacked the Indian embassy in Kabul, killing dozens. Afghanistan\'s government has publicly accused the ISI of having a hand in the attack, an assertion American officials have not corroborated, the paper said.The decision to have Kappes deliver the message about the spy service could be a sign of deteriorating relationship between the CIA and the ISI, which has long been marked by mutual suspicion and dependence, the report said.The CIA has depended heavily on the ISI for information about militants in Pakistan, despite longstanding concerns about divided loyalties within the Pakistani spy service, which had close relations with Taliban in Afghanistan before the September 11 attacks.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

Ashok Argal, Mahavir Bhagora and Faggan Singh Kulaste ? found them to have been withdrawn from branches of banks in Noida, Faridabad, Gurgaon and other places.Congress leaders, speaking on the condition of anonymity, had emphasised the link of bundles of currency notes to BJP-controlled Madhya Pradesh to suggest that the whole scam had been stage-managed by the BJP to defame the UPA government.Senior party leaders had even suggested that the money was ferried to the Capital on the eve of the trust vote at the instance of a BJP chief minister. Significantly, while the panel favoured a comprehensive probe into the allegation which tainted Manmohan Singh government\'s victory in the July 22 trust vote, its members recognized that it might not be possible for them to quiz either Amar Singh, SP general secretary and the alleged bribe-giver, or Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, since both were members of Rajya Sabha, without the consent of the Chairman of the Upper House.The members, who decided to take the help of technical experts to scrutinise the phone records of persons named by the three BJP MPs, noted the view of Kaul and Shakdhar ? experts on parliamentary procedure ? that Lok Sabha can exercise no jurisdiction over the members of the other House without the consent of its Chairman, Vice-President Hamid Ansari.The first hearing by the panel coincided with V K Malhotra, deputy leader of BJP in Lok Sabha and party\'s representative on it, saying that he would approach Speaker Somnath Chatterjee to expand the committee to make room for two more representatives from NDA ? BJD\'s Brajkishore Tripathi and Shiv Sena\'s Anant Geethe ? along with CPI\'s Gurudas Dasgupta and NCP\'s Shriniwas Patil.In another development, while the panel decided to summon CNN-IBN, which collaborated with the three BJP MPs in the sting on the UPA\'s alleged attempt to bribe them but later decided not to air the contents of the CD, the news channel cited legal opinion to justify its decision. The committee will meet next on July 4 and the three BJP MPs are likely to be summoned on July 7. The committee\'s term is coming to an end on July 11 and it may try to give a report by then to coincide with the monsoon session.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

The ISI\'s role in arming and guiding Taliban has long been suspected and recent evidence has increasingly convinced US that its \"ally\" was batting for the enemy.Sources who are familiar with Washington\'s changing mindset towards its \"ally in the war on terror\" said that the US insistence that Pakistan needed to do much more in the fight against Taliban al-Qaida dominated the interactions with Gillani, who had hoped to focus on increased aid from the US. The meeting was taking place against the backdrop of refreshed attention on the Pakistani establishment\'s links with Taliban, underlined strongly by Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.The assessment of Indian agencies is that the role of ISI in the Kabul attack was beyond much doubt. But while similarly strong evidence had failed to sway the US in the past, sources dealing with American intelligence are sensing a new receptivity since the deepening of the Taliban threat.\"That US had reached a similar conclusion was hardly surprising,\" said a source. The suicide bombing was clearly linked to at least some elements in the ISI calculating that they needed to \"check\" India\'s growing footprint in Afghanistan. Those who planned the attack also hoped to send a signal to Pakistan\'s political establishment.Political authority of the Gillani government is fragile. The ruling coalition is continually wracked by differences and the PM\'s powers are seen to be limited with the \"real\" authority wielded by Pakistan People\'s Party leader Asif Zardari, often from Dubai. But Zardari\'s \"remote\" control seems to have a limited range with the army under Ashfaq Kiyani asserting itself as the most significant power centre in Pakistan. The ISI, under Nadeem Taj, has also scripted its role with the abortive attempt to place it under civilian control lasting barely a day, the government being forced to issue a clarification at 3am on Sunday morning.The ISI does not appear prepared to snap its alliance with jihadi groups even though it has helped US in pursuing al-Qaida leaders from time to time. Yet, this has often been a matter of convenience, often to get an insistent US of its back.With the army not required to seek political clearances for its actions, the military-intelligence complex has often sought to set the agenda which it expects the government to abide by. With the dimunition of President Pervez Musharraf\'s authority, there is no one-stop-shop. While the \"return\" of democracy in Pakistan has been hailed, given its imperfect form, it has caused a few complications.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

It asked CAG to \"specify the terms of reference\" of the proposed performance audit before it takes a call on whether it should submit at all to the constitutional body\'s jurisdiction.According to the minutes of the meeting, CIC decided that CAG should place the terms of reference before it \"for further consideration.\" The discussion followed the request made by CAG last month submitting a list of files that would help evaluate the performance of CIC in fulfilling the object of RTI.Even as it betrayed its resentment at being brought under CAG\'s scanner, CIC took care to spout politically correct rhetoric in the minutes by \"welcoming the concept of promoting transparency in its functioning.\"In an attempt to give a legal cover to its jurisdictional objection, CIC pointed out that it was \"an autonomous entity and the orders passed by it are final and binding, subject to scrutiny only by way of a writ under the Constitution of India.\" Its suggestion that an autonomous body fell outside the ambit of CAG is misplaced.As CAG\'s website shows, \"around 400 non-commercial autonomous bodies and authorities owned or controlled by the Union or the states\" and \"over 4,400 authorities and bodies substantially financed from Union or state revenues\" have already submitted to its jurisdiction.Since CIC does not engage in any commercial transactions, it is apt that CAG chose to do a performance audit rather than a regulatory or financial audit. In a performance audit, CAG ascertains the prescribed system and checks whether rules are being followed in practice and whether the output achieves the objectives of the legislation concerned.The reference to the finality and the binding nature of its quasi-judicial orders indicates that CIC wants to be treated as an extension of the judiciary, which is not subject to any performance audit.The attempt to compare itself to the judiciary is also evident from another decision taken by CIC at the same meeting. It decided to provide vacation to its information commissioners on the lines of the entitlements of SC judges.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

Panel to decide\n31 Jul 2008, 0239 hrs IST,TNN\nNEW DELHI: With the government setting up a six-member panel headed by the head of The Energy Resource Institute (Teri), R K Pachauri, the debate on the Sethusamudram project has come full circle. The case has all through attracted attention more for the religious sentiments involved rather than the environmental questions at the heart of the debate. Now Pachauri and his team will have to, besides contending with an object of faith, consider ideas of science, environment and economics.Critics of the project have raised serious doubts about both the economic feasibility of the project as well as the social and environmental cost the region would end up paying for paltry gains.The Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project (SSCP) is meant to develop a 167-km-long shipping channel in the Palk Bay, cutting short the distance for ships running between the west and east coasts of India, by avoiding the circumnavigation of Sri Lanka. Environmental groups have for long argued that the canal alignment passes too close to the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve, one of the world\'s richest marine biosphere reserves, with 2,600 species of plants and animals.The massive upheaval in the waters caused by dredging and other activities, they have contended, will harm the biodiversity even if the activity is carried out 20 km away from the reserve.Besides this, the Pachauri committee will also have to evaluate whether the current alignment of the canal or any of the other alignments would impact the reef formations ? the Palk Bay has one of the five major reef formations in India. While government has contended so far that there wouldn\'t be any direct damage, ecologists have been quick to point out that mere turbidity in the water can lead to coral bleaching and death.Something Pachauri would find himself at home is the question whether the destruction of mangroves in the region will increase the vulnerability of the region to tsunami-like events. Mangroves provide a natural defence against increasing tropical cyclones, tsunamis and consequent inundation.The Adam\'s Bridge may be a contentious religious symbol but what\'s not doubted is the role the structure plays in regulating pressures from the rough seas of the Bay of Bengal, which helps create a space for marine life.With the ambit of the Pachauri committee wide enough to review the social and economic impacts as well, experts point out that the group of experts will need to go beyond the mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment report, which has a limited purview and has been dodged by controversy.The committee would have to allay the fears of the 330 fishing villages that would be displaced by the project. The project, many independent social and economic assessments have contented, threatens the livelihood resources of more than 1.5 lakh fisherfolk.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

Its activists are under fire for sacrificing 267 goats and 15 buffaloes at Assam\'s famous Kamakhya and Ugratara temples for the \"well-being and stability\" of the UPA government.The puja, which began a day before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh moved the trust motion in the Lok Sabha on July 22, ended at 12 noon on Wednesday with the sacrifice of two more goats and a buffalo. The man at the centre of the unholy rhubarb is SP MLA from Madhya Pradesh Kishore Samrite, although he denies any hand in the ritual.But refuting his claim, Samrite\'s close aides say he had been camping in Guwahati for the special puja since July 21. Temple sources said the meat of the sacrificed animals is \'prasad\' and is distributed among priests and devotees. They also said the puja cost around Rs 12 lakh.Between Saturday and Monday, 242 goats and two buffaloes were sacrificed at the Kamakhya temple, while four goats and two buffaloes each were sacrificed at Kamakhya and Ugratara temples on Tuesday. Kamakhya is a major \'Shakti shrine\' for Hindus who visit the temple in thousands during the four-day Ambabuchi Mela in June every year.Refusing to give details of those behind the sacrifices, Kamakhya Debottar Board secretary Nabakanta Sarma said, \"Thousands of devotees come to the temple. We don\'t ask their identities. It\'s not possible for us to keep a track on devotees.\"While priests defended animal sacrifice as an essential ritual under \'shakti tradition\', animal welfare groups in Assam strongly oppose it. Chairperson of Assam unit of People For Animals, Sangeeta Goswami, while condemning the Samajwadi Party, said the sacrifice of animals sends a wrong message to society.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

I stand by that statement and my remarks,\" Swaraj said on Wednesday.She, however, said that she had not referred to the central government or any party when she made the allegations.The BJP leader also contended that she had not made the statement on behalf of the NDA but were her \"personal remarks\".She had come under attack for the remarks and even NDA allies distanced themselves from her, saying these could be her personal or at the most BJP\'s views.In fact in Mumbai on Wednesday evening, Swaraj reiterated that the Bangalore and Ahmedabad blasts were aimed at \"deflecting\" focus from cash-for-vote scam in Lok Saha and also to gain Muslim votes.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

The silence of the afternoon is broken by the sound of a bus, coming down the winding village road. As the bus comes to a stop, scores of children scramble out and head down a slope towards a building. The building is not a school - in fact, most of the children are coming here after attending regular school. Instead, it is a bridge centre that caters to the children of Purkal and neighbouring villages.This centre is the initiative of 74-year-old G K Swamy, a former economist, who had not even heard of Purkal till 10 years ago. \"It\'s destiny that I\'m here,\" he says, with a smile. His wife, Chini, nods in agreement. The couple was planning to settle down in Hardwar after Swamy\'s retirement, when they were told about Purkal, a small village 20 km from Dehradun. They visited, liked the place, built a pretty house overlooking the Mussoorie hills and settled down to a life of retired bliss.But time hung heavy on their hands. Swamy decided to help a few village children with their studies. The objective, he says, was to help them make the transition to a good English medium school from the village Hindi medium school. \"Poor children have to learn only in Hindi, while children of the elite go to English medium schools. This policy has hindered upward mobility and denied poor children access to good education,\" he says.That was just the beginning. Soon, the few children turned into few more and Swamy\'s house wasn\'t able to hold them all. \"I realised that we needed to organize this operation,\" he says. The result was Purkal Youth Development Society, with the objective of mentoring village kids, giving them intensive tutoring, and eventually access to good quality private schooling.Today, the society has almost 200 patrons, who keep it going through donations. A few years back, the society bought land in Purkal and constructed a centre for the kids with classrooms, a library, a computer centre and a science lab. It has 13 teachers, mostly young adults from surrounding areas. The four or five children that Swamy started with have now swelled to almost 140, coming from Purkal and surrounding villages. Every morning, three buses pick up kids from their villages and take them to school. The society sponsors the education of almost 100 kids in private schools nearby. In the afternoon, the kids are brought to the centre for a wholesome meal after which, they attend structured classes till 7 pm.\"I don\'t think anybody can \'teach\' another person. One can only help in learning,\" says Swamy. In accordance with this philosophy, the teachers at the centre act as mentors, helping the children review their work from school, clarify doubts, address difficulties and provide intellectual and emotional support.Five of the children, who recently passed class XII, have joined professional courses ranging from hotel management and graphic design to even learning Spanish. Swamy\'s emphasis on spoken English has made these children more confident. All of them now speak English fluently ? no mean achievement, considering many of them are first-generation learners and almost all come from extremely poor families.Swamy however, feels there is much more to do: \"Why do we only talk of giving poor children basic education or \'some training\'. Rarely do we think of these children becoming leading professionals. I am convinced that professional success is necessary for the poor to break out of their social situation. It is this access that we must aspire for.\"http://teach.timesofindia.com/\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

By July 28, the last day of receiving applications, the few had transformed into many ? a whopping 88,710 expressed interest in volunteering and 55,035 forms had already come in. Much beyond our modest expectations of 10, 000 volunteers. Teach India had struck a chord ? and how.As we certainly don\'t want to disappoint those who have come forward with such enthusiasm, we have extended what was a three-month commitment to two more three-month terms. So, two more batches of volunteers will be taken on for three-month stints ? the first starts in October and the second in January.Meanwhile, India\'s largest classroom has already taken shape, with some volunteers taking on the mantle of teaching. As Adeline Aubry, United Nations Volunteers (UNV) program officer in India, points out: \"Teach India is certainly the largest campaign of its kind. It has given ordinary Indians the unique and spontaneous chance to channel their willingness and desire to do something good for the country through volunteering.\"Absorbing so many volunteers though is quite a challenge and we couldn\'t do it without our corporate and NGO partners. The list of our NGO partners has also expanded ? 11 more have come on board ? and more are welcome.As for the eager volunteers who are waiting for a response from us, you may have to be patient a little while longer. About 19% of applications have been assigned to an NGO. Of these, 31% have contacted the NGO and 32% have finished orientation.The applications are being processed in batches ? Batch 1 (approximately 10,000 volunteers) is currently being processed. Since most people have shown a preference for weekend teaching slots, placement is taking longer. Almost all NGOs run their programmes on weekdays only, so weekend slots are few and far between. So we urge those of you who really want to participate in Teach India to ask for a shift to any weekday slot by emailing us. Following Batch 1, teaching sessions for Batch 2 will start in October and for Batch 3 in January.For those volunteers who have already made it to the classroom, the journey is proving to be hugely satisfying. \"The kids are fast learners. I have earlier taught MBA students but I can tell you that this experience is very enriching,\" says Lalit Malik, vice-president, American Express, who is teaching 28-30 students aged 4 to 13 at the DLF III centre of SNS Foundation.The children, too, are thrilled. \"Initially, I cried in class but thewere very loving. Now, I enjoy it,\" says 10-year-old Asaan, who stays in a slum near Haji Ali and is being taught by students of Sophia College, Mumbai.http://teach.timesofindia.com/\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

That\'s usually a good position to be in, but it does present its own set of challenges. And the reason the Teach India initiative faces this situation is because of the massive response it has received from people. With almost 89,000 people expressing an interest in signing up for the campaign, we\'re running into the traditional Indian constraint ? inadequate infrastructure.Which is why, having focused on individual volunteers, we\'re now looking for corporates and NGOs to come forward and assist in capacity expansion. Corporates that wish to donate money are welcome to do so ? though we\'ll only be acting as intermediaries between the corporate and the NGO. If you wish to give money, write to us atteach@timesofindia.comand we\'ll put you in touch with the relevant NGO. If you\'re an NGO active in the field of education and are interested in joining as a Teach India partner, please get in touch and we\'ll be happy to talk.NGOs who are already partnering Teach India say additional teaching centers are critical to fully utilize the flood of volunteers we\'ve received. This would be a big help in dealing with the logjam of volunteers on weekends, while significantly reducing the time that elapses between a volunteer sending in an application form and actually starting to teach children. We\'ve been forced to put many volunteers on waiting lists, and we can understand that this might be very frustrating for them. We\'re as eager as they are to get them started in classrooms, and anything that can help achieve this objective would be a welcome booster to the campaign. The will to make a difference has been demonstrated by volunteers but now there\'s a need to show the way with contributing towards capacity building.\"Land is quite a problem, as every inch of space in slums is filled with houses. If companies can help us with money to rent out new premises, it would be of great help,\" says C K Mathew, who is with Delhi-based NGO Dipalaya.It\'s not just cash that counts. Geeta Vankadakrishnan, of Hope Kolkata Foundation points out, \"Apart from donations, corporates can help by providing items like tables for computers and other useful items for our vocational centers.\"\"Nearly 3.5 million children in this country don\'t go to school. Just imagine the number of teachers we are going to require to teach them. So there can never be lack of work for any volunteer,\" points out Amod K Kanth of NGO Prayas. True. So, don\'t let a small thing like paucity of infrastructure get in the way of changing young lives.http://teach.timesofindia.com/\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.

For, the Supreme Court has ruled that wives, children and even parents deserted by their husband, father and children, respectively, will be entitled to get maintenance from the date they filed the application for alimony in the trial court.This ruling reverses a standard judicial practice to grant maintenance from the date of verdict on the application made under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides for interim arrangement for sustenance of the dependents pending decision on a matrimonial dispute.This judgment by a Bench comprising Justices C K Thakker and D K Jain came on a petition filed by a mother of nine, who after three decades of marriage to a bank cashier, faced an uncertain future being deserted by him. Except for the youngest daughter left along with the mother to fend for themselves, the husband lived separately with the rest of the children.While the Bhojpur Family Court ordered the cashier to pay maintenance from July 21, 1997, when the woman and her daughter filed the plea seeking maintenance, the Patna HC reversed it saying they were entitled to alimony from 2006, when the trial court gave its verdict.Terming the interim maintenance granted by trial courts under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code as an immediate measure to save a deserted wife and children from destitution, the Bench said if alimony was directed to be paid from the date of verdict, the husband would keep delaying the proceedings.\"The deserted wife and children are the sufferers who seek shelter of the protective umbrella provided by Section 125 of the Code. If maintenance is not granted from the date of application, the weaker sections are sure to lose confidence in the justice delivery system,\" said Justice Thakker, writing the judgment for the Bench.\"The duration of the litigation is not within the power or in the hands of the applicant and entitlement to maintenance should not be left to the uncertain date of disposal of the case,\" the Bench said, adding it was the husband\'s moral obligation as well as the legal duty to maintain his wife.\nMy Times , My Voice\nGet the replica of your favourite edition of Times of India Feel at home..\nCareers @ TIL | | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Sitemap\nCopyright © 2008 Bennett Coleman & Co.
