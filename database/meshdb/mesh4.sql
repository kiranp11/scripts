Senator Obama, in my view, is head and shoulders above the rest.\nHe has the depth, the reflectiveness, and the resilience to be our next President. He speaks to the America I\'ve envisioned in my music for the past 35 years, a generous nation with a citizenry willing to tackle nuanced and complex problems, a country that\'s interested in its collective destiny and in the potential of its gathered spirit. A place where \"...nobody crowds you, and nobody goes it alone.\"\nAt the moment, critics have tried to diminish Senator Obama through the exaggeration of certain of his comments and relationships. While these matters are worthy of some discussion, they have been ripped out of the context and fabric of the man\'s life and vision, so well described in his excellent book, Dreams From My Father, often in order to distract us from discussing the real issues: war and peace, the fight for economic and racial justice, reaffirming our Constitution, and the protection and enhancement of our environment.\nAfter the terrible damage done over the past eight years, a great American reclamation project needs to be undertaken. I believe that Senator Obama is the best candidate to lead that project and to lead us into the 21st Century with a renewed sense of moral purpose and of ourselves as Americans.\nOver here on E Street, we\'re proud to support Obama for President.\n INDIANAPOLIS: DANNY!E Street Band keyboardist Danny Federici treated Indianapolis fans to a special appearance at Conseco Fieldhouse on March 20th.

Then he tore into \"Radio Nowhere,\" his new single about no sense of direction in our society, and the Boss was reborn like Randy Moss hooking up with Tom Brady.Springsteen sang so vein-poppingly hard you feared he might explode onstage. He performed Friday like music is what matters most, hoping to bring a sense of community -- and a sense of hope -- as he sang about dreams and disillusionments.Read the rest of the review here\nLOS ANGELES TIMES: \"SPRINGSTEEN STILL ROCKING WITHOUT A NET\"Randy Lewis\' Los Angeles Times review of Monday\'s show begins:The moment the lights went down Monday night at the L.A. Sports Arena for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\'s return to a Southland concert stage, a vintage-looking calliope surfaced from beneath that stage playing not just any vintage-sounding midway number but \"That Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze.\"At 58, Springsteen certainly can\'t call himself young any more -- at least not chronologically. Despite the hurricane force he and the E Street Band frequently mustered during their two-hour show, plenty of fans cheering them on no doubt recall the nights of yore when this fabled group was just starting to break a sweat at the two-hour mark.Still, what this outfit does on stage each night remains fairly daring, and the older they get, the greater the risk of the without-a-net abandon with which they administer the sacrament of rock \'n\' roll.Read the rest of the review here\nOAKLAND BREAKOUTSBruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\'s show tonight in Oakland featured three tour premieres: Two Hearts, Racing In The Street and Working On The Highway.

Eyewitnesses were blinded by the impact and house security scrambled for their earplugs. And that was just half-way through the show.See the set lists and food bank information for this show and the rest of the tour on the brucespringsteen.net set list page.\nNEW YORK TIMES: \"SPRINGSTEEN LEAVES GARDEN AUDIENCE EUPHORIC\"Jon Pareles\' New York Times review of Wednesday\'s show begins:The Madison Square Garden crowd joyfully sang along with Bruce Springsteen, not for the first or last time, on Wednesday night, as he reached the chorus of \"Lonesome Day\": \"It\'s all right, it\'s all right, it\'s all right, yeah.\" That\'s what the sound of the E Street Band always says, surging past every bit of disillusionment, loss, bewilderment and bitterness in the verses that the fans also know. The sheer vitality of Mr. Springsteen, 58, belting an entire set of showstoppers straight from the gut and working the stage with his longtime band, provides all the hope the lyrics struggle to find. He\'s as serious as any public figure alive, but he leaves audiences euphoric -- a paradox that only grows more profound as he endures.\"Read the rest of the review here\nBRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WELCOMES THE ARCADE FIRE IN OTTAWAThe Arcade Fire\'s Win Butler and Régine Chassagne appeared on stage with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band in Ottawa, singing their own song \"Keep The Car Running\" (from the great \"Neon Bible\" album), preceded by \"State Trooper\" (a tour premier).

Kern\nThere are plenty of people who follow Springsteen tours, seeing multiple shows across the country. Part of the motivation to do so, aside from seeing friends and sampling local cuisine, is the search for that transcendent experience. You know the one -- where all of the cosmic tumblers fall into place, and you don\'t have a thought about anything else except living right there in the moment, huge smile on your face, no place else you\'d rather be for those two-plus hours.\nPlenty of people feel that way about the one show they see in their hometown. But for the tour followers, those moments don\'t happen every night. They didn\'t happen in Dallas last night, but that\'s not a complaint. As with every Springsteen show, there are moments when the world seems right.\nMax Weinberg has described how he has to watch every move Bruce makes on stage to be ready for anything that gets thrown at him. For many in the crowd, that\'s what a concert is like, too -- all eyes on Bruce, all the time. His performance is so riveting that, as good as they are, the E Street Band seem to be simply providing a vehicle for Bruce to dominate. But if you stop and watch the individual band members, you realize why the E Street Band is so mighty.\nIn some cases, it\'s just the warmth they show for each other. Last night was Max\'s birthday and Bruce gave him his own curtain call at the start of the encores -- even though Max then left the stage, as his drums aren\'t a part of \"Meeting Across the River.\" But it can be something even more subtle: the look on Steve\'s face when Clarence nails a solo; Bruce\'s awe at Nils\' prowess during \"Because the Night\"; Charlie Giordano applauding quietly in the darkness when Bruce mentions Danny during the intro to \"Magic.\"\nThe band\'s ability as musicians sometimes gets overlooked. I\'m not talking about those out-front solos, when you\'re finally made to look at someone other than Bruce. Subtle things, like Garry\'s bass on \"Last to Die,\" the little flourishes Roy has been adding on the intro to \"Jungleland,\" Max getting a chance to show off the delicacy on the kit that he displays on Conan, Soozie\'s fiddle providing color throughout.\nSome of those moments are sometimes bizarre. Is there a front man for any band that would stop in the middle of the show when he notices an entire grammar school class in the front of the pit and carry on a private conversation with them in front of 18,000 people?\nIt\'s these things -- not the setlists (although \"My Love\" to open the set would make me very happy), or the crowd, or the special (and not so special) guests -- that keep me on the road night after night, show after show.\nTuesday, April 8, 2008\nProve It All Night\nI arrived in Anaheim for my third Bruce show in five days (I know, lucky me!) planning to write a blog post focusing on \"the gathering of the tribe,\" the way that hardcore Bruce fans come together for a show and bring with them rituals such as sign-waving and chanting along with certain songs. But the performance put on by Bruce and the E. Street Band on Tuesday night put an end to those plans. The performance was simply breathtaking, astonishing, transcendent, even perhaps historic. Yes, it was that good.\nYou never know when you see a show in Anaheim whether Bruce is feeling like he\'s playing Los Angeles (the entertainment capital of the world) or just another show in the suburbs. Tonight, from the opening strains of \"Thunder Road,\" there was no doubt. Was opening with \"Thunder Road\" a nod to his 1975 performance of the song to open his set at the Roxy in 1975, the version that led off the Live 1975-85 box set? Listening to that historic show (as well as the mind-blowing performance he gave at the Roxy three years later on the Darkness tour), you couldn\'t miss Bruce\'s sense of mission, his desire to prove to the assembled industry players that he was worthy of all the praise he had received.\nYet after \"Thunder Road,\" the set began in a pretty standard way. So maybe Bruce wasn\'t feeling the need to prove anything?\nWrong. The next five songs were a tour de force of Bruce and the band at their best: \"Atlantic City,\" \"Candy\'s Room,\" \"Reason to Believe,\" Prove It All Night\" and then \"Because the Night.\" Showing his command of the moment, Bruce audibled by adding \"Prove It\" to the set (see, he was out to prove something), then audibled again in the middle of the song, whispering to Nils to keep his acoustic guitar and not switch to his electric for his usual incendiary guitar solo. That was because Bruce had determined mid-song (apparently) to also play \"Because the Night,\" and it would be during that song that Nils would do his solo.\nThe next surprise came on \"Brilliant Disguise,\" when Bruce paired with Sister Soozie on the duet, the first time in memory that the female vocal wasn\'t handled by Patti Scialfa. Considering the relationship issues driving that song, it was a curious decision. But perhaps the message wasn\'t about male-female relationships this time. Maybe it was the Bruce-audience relationship he was alluding to, as in, \"you think you know me but maybe you don\'t. Maybe it\'s all a brilliant disguise.\" (Or maybe he just felt like playing it.)\nOr maybe it was a request from Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, who was waiting backstage to once again join Bruce and the band for a words-can\'t-describe electric version of \"The Ghost of Tom Joad.\" This is such a great electric song, something like \"Seeds\"-meets-\"Youngstown\"-meets-\"Murder Incorporated.\" Bruce and Tom spit out the lyrics, highlighting the injustices detailed in the song in a way that the acoustic version doesn\'t convey. And Tom\'s guitar virtuosity cannot be understated. The man is in a league of his own, as he demonstrated during his two solos.\nThe surprises continued when Bruce skipped both \"Devil\'s Arcade\" (which wasn\'t even setlisted) and \"The Rising\" (which was). That let him go straight into \"Last to Die,\" which kept the show\'s tempo and volume high. I adore \"Devil\'s Arcade,\" but I have to admit it is starting to sound a little stale and static, which may be why it got a rest. It\'s such a well-crafted song that perhaps it defies reinterpretation, but Bruce may want to add a guitar solo or some other element to bring it more to life in the concert setting. Another shocker to close, as \"Out in the Street\" again followed \"Badlands,\" the well-established main set closer until Anaheim. (It was great fun, though I\'m not convinced it\'s a main set closer.) During the encores, Bruce then kept the surprises coming, pulling out \"Meeting Across the River\" before \"Jungleland.\" Any Bruce concert with that pairing is one for the ages.\nAnd that, perhaps, was the point of the evening. Let there be no doubt: Bruce Springsteen is an artist for the ages.\nMonday, April 7, 2008\n\"Good evening. We\'re out for blood,\" said Bruce Springsteen a few songs into Monday\'s concert at the Honda Center. After an opening salvo that included the tour premiere of \"LIght of Day\" to open and \"Murder Incorporated,\" this was already evident, but if anyone missed the point, the songs that followed -- \"Trapped,\" \"Reason to Believe,\" and \"Because the Night\" -- would hammer it home. This was the E Street Band at their hard rocking finest.\nBruce may have started the show singing, \"Things can\'t get any worse, they gotta get better.\" But by the time we reached the tour premiere of \"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\" his clear message was that the sentiment was wrong -- that for many people, things are continuing to get worse. Nobody\'s kidding nobody about where this highway is going. Rage Against the Machine\'s Tom Morello, whose band has covered the song in the past, made a stunning guest appearance for this one, and it was a blistering performance: a reinvention of 1995\'s acoustic song as rocking guitar assault, and the heart of the thematic presentation that Bruce put together on this night.\nIt had long been suggested that \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" was originally written with the band in mind, and the performance here certainly lends credence to the alleged origins. This updated version took the timeless elements of the song and framed them for presentation in 2008\'s United States, where nearly 1.3 million properties were subjects of foreclosure activity last year, and 80,000 jobs were lost last month alone. Like the Joad family, people\'s hopes and dreams are being blown away, and this version of the song responded with anger and defiance. It demanded that its message be heard.\nI\'ve always enjoyed seeing Bruce watch someone he really respects, and it was evident that he holds a lot of respect for Morello. Bruce and Tom traded the first two verses and shared the third, with Morello adding extra emphasis to \"Look in their eyes Ma, you\'ll see me,\" spitting out the line with barely controlled fury. Then the guitar solos began, the hardest rocking moment of the tour to date. Morello\'s work here was simply astounding -- scratching, coaxing, and forcing out an epic coda to all the themes brought forth in the song.\nNone of this is to say the show was dour; even in the face of hard times, there are things to celebrate. An impromptu \"Out in the Street\" closed the main set, with the band scrambling to switch instruments for the audibled song after \"Badlands.\"\nThe encores saw a few more guests join the band on stage. After having watched the entire show from the pit, guitarist Bobby Bandiera (of the Asbury Jukes, lately touring with Bon Jovi) joined in for a rollicking \"Ramrod,\" and Sessions Band members Marty Rifkin and Marc Anthony Thompson made an appearance on the show-closing \"American Land.\"\nPrior to the encore opening \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes,\" Bruce repeatedly called out for a response from all the \"California girls\" in the crowd, finally entreating, \"Come on thrill me, I\'m getting old!\" Having witnessed a third outstanding show in four nights, I would have to disagree.\nSAN JOSE, CALIFORNIASaturday, April 5, 2008\nBefore Saturday night, I had only seen Bruce perform in the traditional East Coast strongholds or in the Midwestern Rust Belt -- cities where there is a clear, organic connection between the songs and where they\'re being played. In San Jose, there is no Springsteen tradition: he hasn\'t played here regularly, no legendary shows took place here, and there isn\'t much of California in his lyrics (at least not Northern California). Moreover, San Jose seems antithetical to the Springsteen ethos, as a city of explosive growth that produces consequent feelings of rootlessness, a slick, shiny avatar of the new globalized technology economy. And Silicon Valley was out in force Saturday night at HP Pavilion, as videogame moguls filled the VIP seats and Apple CEO Steve Jobs showed up in the pit. Even so, as the houselights dimmed and a spotlit calliope rose from the back of the stage, plinking out a haunting circus tune, the arena became familiar Springsteen space, by turns carnival, tent revival, dance hall, protest rally, beach party, church service.\nNo need for suspense: it was an excellent show. The set was well-chosen, the band sounded sharp, and Bruce was in excellent voice, especially as the show progressed. Interestingly, some of the strongest performances were songs from the new record. \"Gypsy Biker\" has received rave reviews from previous bloggers, and with good reason: the guitar work was scorching. Soozie\'s delicate harmony on \"Magic\" was bone-chilling, making that song one of the most powerful of the first half of the set. \"Devil\'s Arcade\" was stunning, both musically and visually: beginning with a beautifully hymnic organ line from Charlie Giordano and ending with a heartbeat tattoo on the drums as Max and his kit were illuminated in a vision of pure silver light. Several classics received inspired performances as well: Bruce\'s harmonica solo on \"Prove It All Night\" was pure sexy rock \'n\' roll, and the guitar duet between Nils and Steven on \"Promised Land\" was masterful -- a display of two awesome talents. The only disappointment of the evening was an almost lackluster \"Bobby Jean,\" which couldn\'t quite sustain the crowd enthusiasm following the ever-popular \"Glory Days.\"\nAs in other recent shows, Bruce took requests seriously. A local radio station poll resulted in a performance of \"Fire,\" showcasing the easy rapport (both personally and vocally) between Bruce and Clarence (who now appropriately sits on a gilded throne when he isn\'t playing). Bruce audibled \"Something in the Night\" and \"Detroit Medley\" in response to signs (the latter song from a sign that read \"Ain\'t Too Proud to Beg for Detroit Medley\"). The pit swooned when Bruce picked up and then coyly revealed an \"Incident, Por Favor\" placard (although it was on the setlist anyway, I still want to offer a hearty \"gracias\" for it). Then there was the bald guy in the front who had Sharpied \"Glory Days\" on his shiny forehead. Bruce pulled him on stage and the band rewarded him with a rollicking version of his request. Even if the ink doesn\'t wash off for a week, I bet it was worth it. And while I suggested that there is no longstanding Bruce tradition in San Jose, that may not be entirely true: there was the sign that read \"Bruce, you\'re my real dad!\" Bruce\'s bemused response: \"I was in these parts around 1969....\"\nFor me, the highlight of the show was \"Incident.\" Many people have tried to explain Bruce\'s appeal by talking about identification, suggesting that his songs represent their personal experiences and that he is singing the stories of their lives. While I have no doubt this is true for many fans, this doesn\'t capture my relationship to his music. On Saturday night, when I put my arms around my boyfriend and swayed as Bruce told the story of Spanish Johnny and Puerto Rican Jane, I wasn\'t reliving an experience from my youth. Rather, I was living someone else\'s youth, finding a way into experiences that I never had. And that\'s pretty remarkable.\nSeveral hours earlier, as we waited in line outside the arena to be admitted to the pit, two street preachers harangued the line. Using a bullhorn, they preached brimstone and damnation for all of us who do not sufficiently fear god (and singled out \"queers\" as particularly worthy of eternal torment). It was tempting, during the show, to hear \"Reason to Believe\" as a rebuttal to this kind of fundamentalism. That song was powerful as always, but now performed in a Texas rock arrangement coupled with occasional snatches of aggressive distortion-mic vocals, the song is a strange mix: atheism at a roadhouse.\nBut I think the better response to people like those preachers would be an affirmation of the experience I had at the concert that night during songs like \"The Promised Land,\" \"Badlands,\" or \"The Rising.\" These are songs about faith -- not necessarily faith in God, but faith as a human experience that may (but also may not) allow one to live in the face of loss and horror. Borrowing a term from a philosopher, I consider these songs to be examples of \"prayer demythified,\" prayers that don\'t fit into religious doctrine and that do not necessarily even have an addressee. This is the recognition that the act of prayer has a human meaning, even in the possible absence or inaccessibility of God. During these songs, when Bruce, lit from below, raised his hand above his head, many of us in the crowd matched the gesture. For me, this is a true experience of prayer -- joining with my community to offer a sincere prayer for faith, for hope, and for love.\nSACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIAFriday, April 4, 2008\nDriving up the interstate to Sacramento from the San Francisco Bay Area, it was hard not to think about the last time we made this trip -- almost exactly five years ago, on April 9, 2003. The day Baghdad fell.\nBruce had just returned from two weeks of shows in Australia, and the war had started in his absence from American soil. That historic day was his first chance to comment, and he did so with a passionate opening trio of songs: \"Born in the U.S.A.\" (acoustic, just Bruce on the 12-string, angrily pounding out the tune), followed by \"Who\'ll Stop the Rain\" and \"No Surrender.\"\nIt was a classic artistic reaction to current events, and it left little doubt where Bruce stood on the decision to go to war and its consequences.\nThe first leg of the Magic tour also left little doubt about Bruce\'s point of view. I felt that the setlist and his furious performances reflected an intense anger about the current state of affairs and his sense of powerlessness. Gone, for instance, was the prayerful \"Land of Hope and Dreams,\" replaced as the show closer by the ironic \"American Land\" with its false hopes and foolish dreams.\nBruce\'s apparent loss of hope was a big shock, and it left me conflicted about those shows. I\'d always turned to Bruce for his unyielding message of hope amid despair, but on the first leg, he seemed to have precious little hope to offer. And if Bruce Springsteen had lost hope, I wondered, what hope was there for the rest of us?\nSo as much as I would have never missed an opportunity to see Bruce perform near my hometown, I approached Arco Arena with some trepidation. I wasn\'t sure if I was prepared to live in a world in which I couldn\'t count on Bruce Springsteen to lift me up.\nIt was clear that things had changed with Max\'s opening snare shot, the beginning of the playful teenage love song, \"Spirit in the Night.\" Right from the start, Bruce was much more of his old, loose self -- mugging for the audience, shaking hands, smiling and laughing and generally having a blast.\nDuring his intro to \"Livin\' in the Future,\" Bruce briefly signaled the likely reason for his better mood, making reference to \"eight years coming to an end\" -- clearly meaning the two terms of the Bush Administration. Bruce Springsteen, I thought, had found something new to hope for: better days in a post-Bush America and world.\nBruce also clued us in that this show would be about partying as much as anything when he explained Patti\'s absence. She was home guarding the house, he said, where \"beer kegs were rolling up the driveway, pot brownies were in the oven and a Girls Gone Wild bus was pulling up\" as he was headed to the plane that would take him to California. Ah, youthful innocence! That was just the elixir for a rocker who\'d seen too much. So it was no surprise when Bruce pulled out another classic party song, the frat rocker \"Sherry Darlin\'\" (during which, in a performance decades before, he had told the guys in the audience that it was okay to throw up in their girlfriends\' purses if they needed to). During the encores. he also happily took the suggestion from a sign-holder to \"let Rosie come out tonight\" and subbed the cathartic \"Ramrod\" for the setlisted \"Glory Days\".\nI left Arco Arena feeling much better about Bruce\'s state of mind regarding our country and the world. Bruce had found something new to hope for: a fresh start for our country and the world. Party on!\nVANCOUVER, BCMonday, March 31, 2008\nMy 76-year-old Mom & I had driven to Portland and Seattle, and now for our third and final stop of the tour, it was our hometown show in Vancouver. Due to unexpected traffic on the way to GM Place we made it with little more than five minutes to spare to get a wristband for the lottery... but we made it and got lucky, too, landing a spot in the pit. My husband and my 79-year-old Dad were in seats about eight rows up from where we were standing.\nIt was a great all-around show in Vancouver with a few shake-ups. \"None But the Brave\"! Good choice. The new Magic songs were some of the highlights for us, too, and I love the ZZ Top-ified version of \"Reason to Believe.\"\nMy Mom had a blast as usual at the concert, and I could see several people noticing her singing and dancing along to all the songs -- including Bruce! He apparently remembered his dancing partner from Vancouver 2003, and during \"Dancing in the Dark\" he was looking for a way to get her onstage. Unfortunately, in preparation for the show ending, security had moved/locked the side barriers so there was no good way up. So, no reprise for Mom. Oh well...\nAll in all a great trifecta of Northwest shows -- though we were sad that Patti wasn\'t there, we missed her stage presence for sure. I have to say, we loved the upbeat \"American Land\" ending to the show. Since Bruce skipped the entire Northwest on the Seeger Sessions tour, we missed out on that music live in concert... it sounds like a lot of fun!\nThe Shame of British Columbia(Hey, Bruce said it, not me!)\nThere\'s nothing worse for a Bruce fan than leaving a show without a ticket to another show in your pocket. That\'s the situation I was in after the phenomenal show-for-the-ages that was Saturday night in Seattle (did you hear we got \"Trapped?\"). I got to work Monday morning and had an email waiting from Linda, a woman I met in a GA line during the Rising tour:\n\"I wish I were going tonight.\"\nThose six little words were the genesis of yet another Bruce adventure. Next came a mad quest for tickets followed by a last-minute dash home for my passport and a run for the border. I guess some Mondays you go home and watch Dancing with the Stars, and some Mondays you go to Canada!\nOkay, now I know three concerts in four days seems excessive to the uninitiated. Yes, my coworkers think I\'m a nutter, and my friends roll their eyes. I know I\'m a bit of a freak. I know this. (By the way, if you\'re reading this, chances are you\'re a little bit of a freak, too.) That\'s why I like going to the shows: I\'m among \"my people.\" They get it! And there\'s always a whole bunch of people who are way bigger fanatics than I am, so I seem normal by comparison! It\'s fun to sit around chatting about our \"first time,\" our favorite songs and so much more....\n\"I heard they soundchecked \'Downbound Train\' in Seattle -- think they\'ll play it?\"\"What\'s your screen name on BTX?\"\"You were in the pit in Dallas too! What number?\"\"Have you heard the Atlantic City boot? Oh. My. God.\"\nSo I went to Vancouver with the expectation of another crowd of Springsteen groupies that was ready to rock. Our seats were incredible, in the first section in front of the stage. From there I could see those Bay Area girls I\'d met in the pit in Seattle -- they hit the lottery again and were waving to me from front and center. So lucky! The lights dimmed and the band took the stage at 8:15, launching right into \"Atlantic City.\" Another tour premiere! Linda and I were singing our hearts out.\nBut we were the only people in our section standing. Whaah??\n\"IS ANYBODY ALIVE OUT THERE?\"\nUm, no, not really. Not in Vancouver. Well, maybe sort of. Occasionally.\nSurely the place will erupt with \"Radio Nowhere?\" Not so much. \"No Surrender\"! Still, we\'re the only ones on our feet. Instead of communing with other fans, we were blocking their view. We were dancing, and the couple seated next to us looked at us like we were crazy. And we weren\'t even the crazy dancers -- you know, like the guys down on the floor rockin\' the air guitar like they\'re on stage. (Every show has those guys. I love them.) And oh, yeah - someone nearby had some pretty pungent weed and they were hitting it hard all night. It was pretty funny -- every time we caught a whiff, that couple next to us looked around scowling. Marijuana! At a concert! (In Vancouver!) Shocking!\nOne of those Bay Area girls had commented to me that when a crowd isn\'t into it, Bruce just works harder. He was pulling out all the stops trying to get some life out of this group. Back and forth he went, yelling for people to \"Stand up!\" There were pockets of fans around the arena who got into the spirit. The pit was on fire. But there was still a lot left to be desired. Asking for some help with the chorus on \"Sunny Day\" he said, \"Pathetic! The shame of British Columbia!\" He was joking, but the man had a point. During \"Long Walk Home,\" after enjoining the crowd to sing along on \"Hey pretty darling, don\'t wait up for me\" and getting a most lackluster response, he went back to his center mic, laughing and shaking his head like, \"Well, I tried.\"\nBut the show was great. Two tour premieres and \"Trapped\" again. Love that! When we heard the tell-tale organ notes, we lost our minds, squealing like high school girls. \"The River\" was a treat. \"The Rising\" is one of my favorite songs and, after three nights, I was finally able to put my finger on what was missing. Duh. Patti! Her vocals add an ethereal quality to that song that was missed, and I look forward to her return. Finally, at the end of the main set, the crowd roared to life for \"Badlands.\" \"Rosalita\" didn\'t get half the reception it did in Seattle, but Bruce had a blast with it anyway, and we danced our asses off. The whole band looked like they were having a grand time. It\'s always a party on E Street.\nAny night with Bruce and the E Street Band is a night well spent, even if it means two stops at customs and twice as long on the road as at the show. While trying to stay awake at my desk the next morning, all I could think was: That was so worth it!\nLast, happy birthday to Aunt Susie in West Caldwell, NJ! She gets it, too.\nSEATTLE, WASaturday, March 29, 2008\nThere\'s something so delightfully classic about a Saturday night rock \'n\' roll show, especially one right in the heart of the city. There\'s a heightened excitement and anticipation since people aren\'t running from work or school. They\'ve had time to get dressed up, hang out with their friends, and have a drink or two. And, Saturday night means that parents can get out with their kids. Saturday night in Seattle, I was sitting between two rows of the next generation of Springsteen fans: two teenage girls with their moms in front of us (the moms having seen their first show in 1976 at the Paramount) and a group of 20-somethings behind me for whom this was their third show. (Best overheard conversation: \"Yeah, I want a t-shirt, but get me something cool. Have Mom pick it out.\")\nThe band, too, seemed to be sharing in the communal good spirits. \"Trapped\" as a set opener (probably due to the plethora of signs present in Portland the night before) immediately engaged and excited the crowd. When people are standing at the top of the 200 level and pumping their fists, you know the night\'s going to be a good one. Tonight, the rarities flowed within the set instead of standing a little bit outside of it. \"Because the Night\" got a tremendous response even before Nils brought his usual brand of outstanding sonic wizardry to a solo that was still being applauded minutes after the song ended.\nA dedication for \"Ed\" in Seattle probably only means one thing, and we thank Mr. Vedder for coaxing Bruce into playing \"Your Own Worst Enemy\" -- and also bet that \"Point Blank\" came out of the closet for that same die-hard fan who first saw Bruce live on the River tour. People may make pilgrimages to see Bruce in Jersey, but in the Northwest, you could have heard a pin drop during \"Point Blank\": every word, every nuance was there for you to hear, and not shouted over by some moron screaming for \"Rosalita\" all night. The stellar performance gave me goosebumps and flashes of my own first River tour show (Hartford 1980, if you\'re keeping score).\nWhen I spotted the \"Rosie\" sign in the pit earlier in the evening, I had labeled it as \"optimistic.\" In a million years, I did not expect Bruce to reach into the crowd, pull out the sign, turn around and show it to the band, and then, finally, with an enormous, I-know-something-you-don\'t-know grin, turn around and show it to us. When Bruce wants to sing it, \"Rosalita\" is quintessential Springsteen, and bringing her out tonight was every possible shade of appropriate for this show and this crowd. Everyone was dancing everywhere: behind the stage, behind the soundboard, up in the rafters, in the guestlist seats, people singing words that they were sure they had forgotten, friends hugging and total strangers high-fiving. Bruce onstage, hamming it up, mamboing across the front of the stage with a grin as big as the venue.\nBy the time the show ended, it didn\'t matter if it was your first show or your 30th, everyone knew they had seen something special.\nTop of Their Game\nEven stiff Seattle spring rain couldn\'t dampen the crowd outside Key Arena on Saturday night. My wife and I ducked into the arena around 7:45 for what was my seventh Springsteen show (fourth with the E-Streeters), and the concourses vibrated with energy. You know how it is: anyone you make eye contact with becomes your new best friend because, hey, you\'re at the Springsteen show... and everyone who\'s there knows what that means.\nWell, at least that\'s how it felt before the show started. I have to admit that up in section 202, in and around row 3, we were searching for a pulse at times. Not because Bruce wasn\'t amped (more on that soon), but because -- I guess? -- the crowd is getting older or more conservative or something. (Overheard behind me in row 4: \"Hey, Steve, you want me to come BMW shopping with you tomorrow?\" Tramps like us, indeed.)\nAnd to be quite honest, I was worried that, after hearing rumblings of less-than-compelling shows in Cincinnati and Portland, if the Seattle faithful couldn\'t bring the heat, the energy, the noise, Springsteen would return the favor and we could be in for a disappointing night.\nBruce immediately put those worries to rest. I don\'t think the Seattle crowd ever completely kicked it into gear, but Bruce could not have cared less (nor I, for that matter -- my wife and I were some of very few in our section up and dancing for the majority of the show). It was by far the most satisfying Bruce show I have ever seen. From the opener of the trigger-wound \"Trapped,\" with the bombastic chorus after those seething verses, Bruce put us on notice that this was going to be a special night. He\'s so good, he can open with a non-album track -- unbelievable! \"Gypsy Biker\" -- probably my fave from the new record -- was fantastic live, as was \"Magic.\" Very powerful. Then \"Reason to Believe\" was a revelation, showing the wonderful evolution from the Nebraska \"demo\" to the Tom Waits-inspired D&D tour performance, now into a full-fledged band version, completely rockin\' and dynamic, bringing together the best elements of all the songs\' previous incarnations.\nThe highlights just kept coming: \"Because the Night,\" \"She\'s the One,\" \"Livin\' in the Future,\" \"The Promised Land\"... on all of these Bruce was cutting loose, having fun, strutting, sweating, a 58-year-old rocking out harder than any of us 36-year-olds could (and utterly putting all the BMW-shopping 58-year-olds to shame). All night he seemed loose, passionate, in the flow -- he was having a blast! Then he killed me with a mesmerizing \"Point Blank,\" the band expertly extracting its evocative essence, and Bruce singing (dare I say it) beautifully.\nThe encore missed a couple things I had hoped for (\"Girls in Summer Clothes,\" perhaps a Born in the U.S.A. classic), but the double-shot of \"Rosalita\" -- with Bruce dancing, goofing, posing, and the band in perfect union -- with a \"Born to Run\" chaser was, for me, Springsteen nirvana. I hope and pray to see Bruce & the E Street Band again someday, but if for some reason it never happens, I can rest in peace, knowing I have witnessed the master at the top of his game. And that is an awe-inspiring thing to still be able to say, think, and write in 2008.\nEuphoria! That\'s what I feel tonight. \"Trapped\"! We got \"Trapped\"! I still do a little dance every time I think of it. First song of the night! The band was rusty on this one, and Bruce joked that it\'s supposed to start off with a sweet organ intro that they didn\'t get quite right, but a little uncertainty is \"good for the band.\" No one was complaining. I didn\'t get a chance to flash my sign for \"Trapped\" because it got confiscated right after we got into the pit -- I guess signs, though in abundance, are not technically allowed? Nevertheless, I hit the pit lottery, so life was good. Stood in the rain freezing for a couple hours, but it was totally worth it. We joked that this was a crowd that would truly appreciate \"Waitin\' on a Sunny Day.\" How sweet it was when we got that too! (Though while singing this one, Bruce plucked a \"Sunny Day\" sign from someone in the pit. No signs? Sheesh.)\nSuffice it to say, from my vantage point, it was all good. So good. I was three deep from the stage, front and center. I was behind a 14-year-old who I noticed knew every word to every song, and a group of fun girls from the Bay Area who were up for the PNW trifecta of Portland/Seattle/Vancouver. Next to me was a woman who was 39-and-a-half weeks pregnant. It looked like Bruce might have a new fan at any moment. Security was nervous. During the show, Bruce and Stevie both gave her and her belly a nod and a smile.\nThe house was packed -- I couldn\'t see any empty seats anywhere -- and my home crowd came ready to rock. As seems to be the norm lately, this show was marked by audibles all night. \"No Surrender\" was the first, and after they started, we saw Nils smile and shake his head at Bruce and say \"You\'re crazy.\" With favorites like \"Darkness\" and \"She\'s the One,\" it\'s hard to pick a highlight, but \"Because the Night\" was a huge crowd pleaser. \"Your Own Worst Enemy\" made a rare appearance in the setlist, and the band is still working out the kinks. Bruce was laughing in the beginning and counted off the song twice to get it going. This was followed by another tour debut, \"Point Blank.\" Slow and deliberate, it paved the way nicely for \"Devil\'s Arcade.\"\nThe encore kicked off with another sign request from the pit, as Bruce asked for the sign and held it up to the band and then the crowd: \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out.\" Sweet! Yet another sign prompted the next song, and when he revealed it to read \"Rosalita,\" the crowd went nuts. Bruce had a lot fun with this one, and the whole arena was right there with him.\nAnd of course, I was right there from the beginning: \"Trapped\" from a primo spot in the pit... it doesn\'t get any better than this. What a weekend!\nBefore the show started, we spied Eddie Vedder in the wings, and the pit was abuzz with the possibilities. I have always wanted to hear Eddie sing with Bruce. They\'ve done it before, but I\'ve never gotten my hands on a recording. As singer-songwriters, I think they have so much in common, it would have been such a treat. However, the show wasn\'t wanting for anything (we got \"Trapped,\" after all, did I mention that?), so no complaints from me!\nPORTLAND, ORFriday, March 28, 2008\nFor All the Northwestern Girls!\nI have to fess up. I\'ve been known to make disparaging comments about West Coast crowds (come on, the L.A. crowd in October deserved it!). But Portland made me proud. So this is my official apology to the fine folks in the Rose Garden Arena: I\'ll see a show with you guys anytime! Bruce and the gang hit the stage around 8:35, a little later than I would\'ve guessed, and the crowd had already been roaring for Bruce for 20 minutes. From the darkness came Bruce\'s rallying cry, \"Is there anybody alive out there?!\" Over and over he yelled, whipping the crowd into a frenzy before the lights even came up. Then, lights on, and the band exploded into \"Night.\" First song and already Bruce and Little Stevie are sharing a mic, Nils and Clarence have their moments, and you know it\'s going to be one to remember.\nNils lit up the stage with several killer solos during the top half of the show. By the time we got to \"Prove It All Night,\" I was thinking, \"Damn, it\'s the Nils Lofgren show tonight.\" I heard an interview with Nils on a local radio show the day before the concert. He explained that Bruce is commuting to shows, sometimes arriving just one-and-a-half or two hours before the show. They sometimes have no soundchecks; he hasn\'t been sticking to a setlist; audibles every night. Nils said Bruce will let \'em know about five or six songs he\'s been thinking of -- some they haven\'t played in ten years. \"Sometimes he\'ll shout something out in the dark and start counting it off...\" Nils called it \"an exciting, seat-of-your-pants adventure.\" Indeed. For all of us!\nWord has obviously spread that Bruce has been taking requests via signs in the audience, and last night\'s crowd had plenty. I was surprised by how many audibles came right from the signs. \"For You,\" \"Lost in the Flood\" (sweet), and then \"Jungleland\" from a spiffy sign right in the pit. I counted four signs for \"Trapped.\" Alas, no luck on that rarity. (Full disclosure: I had one for \"Trapped\" and I gave one to a friend in the pit, but there were others, too!)\nOne thought I kept coming back to: this is not the same show I saw in L.A. in October. Maybe I can\'t blame it all on the L.A. crowd (though the guy next to me did check Monday Night Football scores during the show. Who does that?!). New album, early in the tour, fans aren\'t up to speed yet. Man, oh, man, how these songs have come together, and the Portland crowd was ready. \"Magic\" is now a song that Soozie makes shine. And I never expected \"Long Walk Home\" to be so damn much fun. Over and over Bruce called for us to sing along, \"Hey pretty darling, don\'t wait up for me, gonna be a long walk home.\" Mostly though, I feel like these new songs had a poignancy they lacked at the earlier show. This time around, \"Gypsy Biker,\" \"Devil\'s Arcade,\" \"Living in the Future\"... they seemed to resonate more with the crowd, and it was a better show for it.\nThe encore kicked off with \"Girls in their Summer Clothes,\" Bruce sending it out to \"all the Northwestern girls.\" This elicited squeals from the ladies that made the guy next to me cover his ears. Jealous, no doubt. This was followed by \"Jungleland,\" after which my buddy (a veteran of 30-plus shows) said, \"That might be the best \'Jungleland\' I\'ve ever heard.\" Bruce left nothing on the table with that one. I\'ll risk cries of blasphemy and admit I\'ve never been a huge fan of that one, but this performance won me over. I get it now.\nNext stop, Key Arena, home of the Seattle Sonics (um, for now anyway). I\'ll be heading down to the Key with my \"Trapped\" sign and my GA ticket to try for a spot in the pit. Wish me luck!\nCOLUMBUS, OHIOMonday, March 24, 2008\nFly me to the moon\nby Ed Hall Jr.\nWell, Columbus was a bit crowded Monday night, what with the return of Ohio State students from spring break and a Buckeyes men\'s tournament basketball game happening one arena over. But the only event that mattered, really, was the one that bumped the basketball team from their home court: Bruce and the E Streeters.\nThis was my third time seeing Bruce at this arena, and with my girlfriend\'s 18 year old singer-songwriting son in tow for his first show, we took our spot on the rail. Talk of Cinci peppered our conversation with fans around us. I must say that Bruce and his band deserve to have a mortal night, we all understand. He just sets the bar so damn high. So we (who pay attention) take notice and wonder if, coming back after Easter, full of ham and mashed potatoes (and maybe getting wind of some Cinci feedback), Bruce would remain earthbound, or come out and shoot for the moon.\nFact is, it was in between, leaning heavily towards the luminous orb, to be sure.\nBruce rolled out on stage just before 8:30 and then laid out a show full of curveballs and priceless audibles. As a \"Darkness\" freak, the only thing that would have made the four selections from that disc that made it into tonight\'s show any better would have been a slot for \"Racing in the Street.\" But I accidentally left our sign in the car, so that one was on me. \"Something in the Night\" was some powerful stuff. It felt church-like as Bruce laid out the tune steadily, with his Tele chiming away and the anticipated wails punctuating the song. He didn\'t hit \'em all, so I helped a little.\nThe house was packed, and there were dozens of children in tow. I love this. I can only imagine the thrill it is to bring your own child to one of these shows. Many had signs, some were right up against the stage, and it seems to add to Bruce\'s enthusiasm as he plays to them during the show as he did last night. When he comes down stage to let someone else \"play\" his guitar, he gives room for the smaller hands to take the \"lead.\"\nOne standout: \"Because the Night\" burned up the joint and was truly a pleaser, including Nils\' stunning turn. I love that man.\nBut signs, signs, they were, yes, everywhere. And eventually, Bruce walked over to stage left, pointing to someone in the crowd and making the shape of a square with his hands. Taking the small sign center stage, he showed the request to the band, all around, and then, after we politely requested he show us the sign, did we all get a little freaky at getting \"Incident\" laid upon us tonight.\nI was trying to both watch the show and keep my young guest up to speed. He knew most songs and was going home to write a piece for his high school newsletter. He didn\'t know what it meant for \"Rosie\" to come out (for what I think is only the second time this tour). Or how certain songs make you feel, like when you were 16 and listening to \"Adam Raised a Cain\" over and over on your cheap stereo. He was the observer/participant amongst a roomful of peaceful, energetic, mostly middle-aged, longtime fans.\nYes, Bruce and the boys (and girl) are allowed to play two-hour sets and leave folks scratching their heads. He can also come out and burn it up, like he did two days later a degree or two north and east. As I told my friend, that\'s why we go and go and go. Even in Columbus, a handful of tired notes, off guitars and a tough start on one harmonica solo aren\'t enough to turn away even for a second. This is Bruce, man. You just don\'t turn away from Bruce. Unless, of course, you\'re on your way to get tickets for the next show.\nBruce and the band left the Buckeye State on top, and thankfully, I and a new convert were there to see it.\nIncidentally, No Magic in Columbus\nBefore the Cincinnati show, I told some friends that just once, I\'d like to be \"between the mics,\" that small portion of the front of the pit between Bruce and Steve. The lottery odds of that are rather small, of course, but last night my number came in. So, any veneer of objectivity I might otherwise pretend in a review will be absent in this one, there\'s just no way. My ears are still ringing, I\'m operating on three hours sleep, I have a meeting with a new boss in half an hour, and, and... I\'m feeling just fine.\nEven taking into account a once-in-a-lifetime (so far) position, I\'ve seen Bruce enough times (73) to know that last night\'s show was pretty hot. Right from the opening salvo of \"The Ties That Bind,\" Bruce and the band were on a mission. Shaking things up just four songs in to the set, Bruce circled the stage multiple times to call out for \"Adam Raised a Cain\"; Charlie Giordano, unable to read Bruce\'s lips, missed the beginning of the song while getting the translation. Did it matter? Hell, no. I\'ll remember it for one of the more fiery performances I\'ve seen, including Bruce tearing into his guitar solo at the end.\n\"Magic\" was dropped from the setlist last night. That meant losing part of the spoken \"message,\" though I believe it was covered well enough during \"Livin\' in the Future.\" With the relatively quiet number removed, the show had virtually no letups -- rockers and classics all. It also opened up the set a bit for a different selection from the Magic album, and last night\'s debut performance of \"You\'ll Be Comin\' Down\" was more than worthy.\nHighlights? Way too many to remember them all. \"Something in the Night.\" Nils possibly topping the \"Prove It all Night\" solo from Cincinnati with a blow-out on \"Because the Night.\" Bruce\'s guitar playing on \"Adam Raised a Cain\" and on \"Incident on 57th Street.\" Every time Clarence played the bari sax. \"Long Walk Home,\" with Steve\'s new vocals at the end. A cameo by Ed Manion on bari sax during \"Born to Run,\" leading Bruce to say, \"C\'mon, Big Men!,\" and also producing the biggest, baddest sound I have ever heard for that song. And \"Rosalita.\" Yes, \"Rosalita\"!\nOne bit of strangeness, likely to become a recurring event at Springsteen shows, was the song contest winner. There are advertised contests for several upcoming shows for fans to select a song. Last night the \"winner\" -- and who knows how many voted; no one near me was aware of a contest for last night\'s show -- was \"Sherry Darling.\" Bruce asked who picked \"this bastard,\" prompting Stevie to raise his hand (Stevie used another little gesture involving both hands a little later when Bruce announced \"sexy time\").\nEveryone on stage appeared to be in high spirits, having a great time being with each other and giving Ohio everything they had. My favorite interaction was after \"Sherry Darling,\" when Bruce found a sign in the pit that read, \"Incident, Please,\" then, after holding it up, walking over to the piano to say to Roy, \"Incident, Please!\" Pure magic.\nCINCINNATI, OHSaturday, March 22\nLeave \'Em Wanting More\nAt just about 10:30 p.m. on Saturday, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band left the stage, having just completed \"American Land\" before a nearly packed house at U.S. Bank Arena in Cincinnati. The crowd was loud and had been on its feet -- even back in section 201-- for nearly the entire show. But, even before Springsteen was off the stage, the house lights were on. At barely two hours, the show was over.\nOn the floor, some long-time fans were apoplectic. What the #%&!? Anyone with an internet connection knew that, in the prior two shows, fans had been treated to incredible guest appearances. Not that anyone expected anything like that again, but here we were, on a Saturday night, with a phenomenal crowd, and it was already over?\nSure, we\'d collected a bunch of moments. An unusual (and unrushed) opener of \"Darlington County.\" Consecutive audibles by Bruce, the first shouted out to Max and Garry during \"Reason to Believe\" to follow with \"Candy\'s Room,\" and then for \"Prove It All Night.\" An incendiary, wailing, gun-slinging, foot-stomping (literally) solo by Nils Lofgren to punctuate \"Prove It All Night.\" An audience scan for signs, leading to a relatively rare performance of \"Be True.\" Following that, a show-stopping \"Lost in the Flood\" before the final five songs of the main set. And, as likely captured on YouTube already, an encore dance with Hannah during \"Dancing in the Dark.\" Still, I couldn\'t escape the feeling that Bruce rushed the band through the final hour of the show as if he were late for the plane.\nNot that the performance suffered too much from the breakneck pace. Clarence sounded great. Charlie Giordano fit right in, adding his own textures from Danny\'s spot. Patti wasn\'t there (Bruce\'s explanation, as it were, included a terribly lame joke about dealing with the kids and the hash brownies back home), so Soozie helped out with \"Magic.\" If anything, the themes of death, life, despair, faith and hope that run through the set, and the final sequence starting with \"Devil\'s Arcade,\" were amplified by the pace. The playing was nearly flawless, and Bruce\'s voice was in fine form. And that solo from Nils on \"Prove It All Night\" - put that one on brucespringsteen.net, please! If it was Bruce\'s intent to keep the audience out of breath and begging for more, it worked.\nBut just as fast as all the songs had been, that\'s how fast it was all over. Or so it seemed.\nThe techs came out to gather the equipment, with the roadies to follow to take down the stage. That was it. Some fans filed out, some celebrated the evening, and some, well, were asking \"What the #%&!?\"\nThat\'s when the roar went up from behind the stage, as Bruce and the band re-appeared -- with the house lights still on -- to re-take the stage. Fans rushed back to their seats, equipment was plugged back in, techs were sent scrambling. \"Kitty\'s Back\" was a lovely mess, with Max flubbing some of the opening beats, Clarence\'s tech struggling with the Big Man\'s neck strap, and an extended guitar solo from Bruce. They gave \'em a helluva time. And left \'em wanting more.\nINDIANAPOLIS, INThursday, March 20\nAs showtime approached in Indianapolis on Thursday, I thought, \"I\'ve never seen an E Street Band show without Danny Federici -- I wonder what this will be like.\" It turns out I still don\'t know what it\'s like. Danny\'s surprise appearance -- and really, who could have predicted he\'d show up in Indianapolis, of all places? -- made for an intensely emotional show about the ties that bind us. Bruce and the band came out hot, with tight rocking versions of \"Night,\" \"Radio Nowhere,\" and \"Lonesome Day,\" and then turned up the heat with a white-hot version of \"Gypsy Biker,\" with a screeching guitar solo from Steve. \"Magic\" and \"Reason to Believe\" put the big questions of the night on the table, about the lies we tell ourselves, the illusions we let ourselves fall for. But when Bruce started requesting that the folks in the pit hold up their signs and we ended up with a ragged-but-right \"Rendezvous,\" things broke open. The triple shot of \"Rendezvous,\" \"She\'s the One,\" and \"Because the Night\" were all passion and desire, what happens to us in the heat of the night when the lights go out and we struggle with our own lies and illusions, where we stumble and fall and can\'t make it right. \"Livin\' in the Future\" was the challenge that we wake up and not sleep through the destruction around us -- political or personal.\nAnd then Danny came out for \"The Promised Land,\" and all bets were off. Bruce and the band manage to make this song sound fresh year after year, but this performance, with Danny\'s organ crying out, driving the band, felt like I was hearing it for the first time. \"Take a knife, and cut this pain from my heart\" is the bargain we have to make to get to the promised land, a promised land with all the scars in the songs of the first half of the show, all the band\'s scars, all of the pain Danny must be going through. Then, release: \"Spirit in the Night\" and \"Sandy,\" sending us all the way back to the band\'s beginnings, played with love and soul. I hadn\'t heard \"Sandy\" since 1981 at the Philly Spectrum, and it took in all those years of following these guys around, looking for Bruce\'s new ideas, seeing how we were growing up together. Danny left after that. There was the potential for a letdown at that moment, given that we\'d gone so far back in the past, flirting with nostalgia. But in the run from \"Devil\'s Arcade\" to \"Badlands,\" Bruce drove back to the heart of this new show and Magic, putting all the hard questions back on the table about war and community, the spitting contest between us and the badlands. \"Long Walk Home\" made sure that we didn\'t get stuck in the past of \"Spirit in the Night,\" hanging out with Hazy Davey and the gang at Greasy Lake. It\'s going to take a lot longer to get home than the length of a Bruce Springsteen concert.\nDanny came back out for the encore, which we expected to be \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes.\" Bruce said that they were going to do the next one for Danny, and Roy played the opening notes of \"Backstreets,\" Bruce\'s greatest song about friendship. They soared. I stood there thinking about how hard it is to hold on to people over the years, and how important it is to weave together a community that can sustain you when your other reasons to believe fail. This music has challenged me to do it, and has given me sustenance when not much else was around, for most of my life. A scorching, swinging \"Kitty\'s Back\" -- with a killer guitar solo from Bruce -- reminded us that sometimes all we need to do is dance: \"Oo-oo what can I do?\"\nThanks to Bruce and the band for this one. Forever friends.\nDanny\'s Back in Town!\nThe Magic tour produced arguably it\'s greatest \"trick\" thus far, with the reappearance of Danny Federici at the Conseco Fieldhouse. Bruce and the Band clearly responded to Danny\'s presence on stage with a show spotlighting the Phantom on such classics as \"Spirit in the Night,\" \"Sandy,\" and \"Kitty\'s Back.\"\nDanny played in a three-song set in the middle of the show (\"The Promised Land,\" \"Spirit,\" and \"Sandy\") as well as the entire five-song encore, highlighted by Danny and Roy trading solos on the keyboards during \"Kitty.\" During Danny\'s time on stage, all of the E Streeters paid tribute by making their way over to the keyboard platform to play alongside their \"blood brother.\"\nBruce and the band were in the Spirit tonight in general, playing to the crowd and eagerly playing off their energy -- not to mention their signs. At one point, Bruce called out \"Let\'s see those signs!\" and responded to one from the pit by playing \"Prove It All Night.\" Later, after spotting a sign that called for \"Rendezvous,\" Bruce obliged by performing the Tracks rarity. During the encore, spotting a sign that read \"Dance with me,\" Bruce not only provided a rousing rendition of \"Dancing in the Dark\" but brought the young lady to the stage twice to dance and helped her back into the pit with a kiss on the cheek.\nClearly evident in Conseco tonight was the multi-generational appeal of Bruce and the Band. There were numerous examples of children and even grandchildren of long-time fans in the arena. In my own case, my family celebrated my wife Terri\'s birthday by attending the show together. My son Nick (and Amanda), my daughter Joanna (and Fred) and my grandsons Brennen and Carter all rocked to Bruce and the E Street Band!\nAfter a great night in Indy, for Terri and I it is off to Cincy for Saturday\'s show. I\'m not sure what Bruce can come up woth to top this evening but we can\'t wait to find out...\nMILWAUKEE, WISCONSINMonday, March 17\nThe Shamrock Shuffle, E Street Style\nThree songs into Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\'s St. Patrick\'s Day show in Milwaukee, I found myself nervous I would see a solid show, but one where the band coasted on material they knew like the back of their hand. As the ever-conventional \"Lonesome Day\" ended, Springsteen stood front and center and the E Street Band manically tore through the opening to \"Streets of Fire,\" a forgotten gem from Darkness on the Edge of Town. Unlike some performances of the song in 2003, this time an angry jolt paired with manic hydraulics from the band made the performance not just incendiary but flat-out devastating. This was one of these songs I never imaged ever seeing live, let alone having it be so unyielding and definitive. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why legions of fans travel far and wide to see Bruce Springsteen, because one never knows what magic may occur on any given night at any city in the world.\nMilwaukee has always had a rich history with Bruce Springsteen, from the infamous \"Bomb Scare\" show back in 1975, to being only the second region where he played an outdoor show (Alpine Valley in 1984), to the band\'s explosive penultimate stop of their 2003 tour, to the wondrous Devils & Dust concert where he aired five songs from Nebraska. Milwaukee has always been the Midwest version of Philadelphia to Springsteen -- I\'m not sure why, but the performances always seem to be a step above the rest. This St. Patrick\'s Day special was no exception.\nOn \"Streets of Fire,\" Springsteen\'s guitar work lit up the sky as the band oozed with determination and defiance. The performance of \"Gypsy Biker\" was elevated because of what had preceded, it proving that shaking things up and taking on a challenge can reap huge rewards. Feeding off of the energy from \"Streets,\" Van Zandt and Springsteen ventured into another realm on \"Gypsy Biker\" with some searing guitar work.\nThe revelations continued to unfurl all night. \"It\'s Hard to Be a Saint in the City\" found Van Zandt and Springsteen dueling once again, facing off like gun fighters from the Wild West to trade licks and riffs that congealed into a walloping crescendo. I somehow doubt this particular song was well known by more than half of those in attendance, yet somehow the crowd was there every moment of the way because of the band\'s chemistry and ability to raise their game. Even the warhorses that appeared sturdy yet tired a few nights earlier in Omaha were more fluid and free in Milwaukee: the faithful and fervent \"Prove It All Night,\" the blues-drenched \"Reason to Believe\" and the virtuosic victory lap of \"She\'s the One\" all hit the mark.\nYou should have felt the walls of the arena shake when the band\'s burbling hydraulics took the crowd to new heights during \"Cadillac Ranch.\" Springsteen didn\'t even need to sing as the crowd\'s voices soared beyond the walls of the arena onto the chilly Milwaukee streets. The adrenaline rush was similar to the one I felt in Convention Hall back in December 2000 when my friend Paul and I witnessed the band tear into \"Rosalita\" -- one of those perfect moments you wish you could bottle for\n');
