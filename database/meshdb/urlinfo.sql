The Smera is a two seat, four wheel electric vehicle that is narrow enough to maneuver as a motorcycle. We?ve heard of small vehicles, but the Smera is taking thin to a new transportation extreme.\n\n\n\nThe Smera is 2.4 metres (8 feet) long, and 80 cm (less than 3 feet) wide. It can hit a top speed of 80mph, and will take you 93 miles on one charge. The vehicle is quite narrow, and handles more like a motorcycle than a car, tilting around curves rather than turning. The wheels are powered by dual electric 20hp motors, which according to the manufacturers, will last you for 200,000 km. It is powered by a 144 volt lithium ion battery, which can be charged in a few hours.\n\nIt is certainly a small vehicle, and a powerful one for its size. Here?s hoping that this vehicle, which at the moment is but a concept, does make it into production by 2009.

NIC filters out the desired packets which system is entitled to recieve. However by setting the NIC to promiscuous mode the sniffing application receives packets regardless of the system being the intended destination. Sniffing is a difficult problem to acertain as it does not interfere with the network traffic, leaving no digital traces to track.<br /><br /><br />My Approach in theory<br />=====================<br />A  ?dynamic? protocol like Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) can be leveraged to detect the sniffing host. This protocol works alongside the Internet Protocol(IP) in Layer 3. On account of this ARP\'s operation occurs automatically in the background, without concern to the application user. <br /><br />ARP works by sending an address request and collecting the response to create its mapping of addresses. The hardware addresses are only needed for hosts on the local network. At the lowest level, the Ethernet driver needs the hardware address of the remote system to which it will send a packet. When it does not have that address, it ?broadcasts? a request for the missing address. This request, called an ?ARP request?, contains the IP address of the host in question and is sent to all systems on the local network. A system may respond with a reply, called an ?ARP reply?, which contains the host IP address and hardware address. The response received is used to build a table of IP addresses and hardware addresses.<br /><br />Another feature of the protocol is called ?gratuitous ARP?. This occurs when a host broadcasts an ARP request for its own hardware address. A Solaris system does this at boot time. It is used to detect if another system is using its IP address, indicating a misconfigured system. The other use of gratuitous ARP is to send updated<br />hardware address information. Systems that receive requests like this will automatically update the hardware address information for that host.<br /><br />ARP by default uses BROADCAST method to get the destination MAC address. The idea here is to craft an ARP packet with the destination address being a non-BROADCAST address with a specific target IP address. If the NIC is in non-promiscuous mode, the packet is ignored and after the specified TTL no response is got back. However if the node with the corresponding IP address is in promiscuous mode, a prompt response is given by the sniffing host as the packet is percolated to the higher layers.<br /><br />Using a handcrafted packet like ICMP with appropriate fields can induce the same effect. <br /><br />References<br />----------<br />-Defeating Sniffers and Intrusion Detection Systems<br />http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=54&id;=10#article<br /><br />-Plummer, Dave.
