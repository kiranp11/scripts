(With options, container is a definition list, header dt, content dd)\n14. November 2006 |12:36\nHi Sándor, thanks for your report.\nThe bug is now fixed.\n21. November 2006 |17:58\nIs there a way to set it so that none of the children are displayed by default? Just the list of headlines?\n4. December 2006 |10:37\nGreat menu! Works Brilliantly! Only in Firefox though after stying the elements? ??\nWhy does it not work in IE6 and 7?http://www.restor.co.za/Edwards_info.aspx\n4. December 2006 |15:29\nAndrew, the accordion works fine in IE. Try to update to the latest revision of jQuery, otherwise it?s quite likely that there is a problem within your page. If you can?t find a cause there, please ask on the jQuery mailing list for help.\n14. December 2006 |20:28\nAny chance to change the background colour when you hover over a header?\n14. December 2006 |20:40\nYou you should be able to achieve that effect with some simple jQuery:\nJust add a class hover to your stylesheet with another background colour, eg:\n14.

January 2007 |12:42\nmaurice: Da das Plugin sehr flexibel ist, was die zugrundeliegende HTML-Struktur angeht, sollte das durchaus möglich sein. Zuerst einmal brauchst du die Möglichkeit, dort überhaupt beliebiges Javascript einzubinden.\nWenn dir das auch nicht weiterhilft, müsstest du etwas genauer beschreiben, wo du das Plugin einsetzen willst.\n18. January 2007 |08:15\nHello, I presume you would know but this plugin is not working with JQuery 1.1\n18. January 2007 |21:33\nI?ve tried combining your example with the latest version of jQuery but it didn?t work. It only works with your jquery.pack.js. Shouldn?t be jQuery backwards compatible?\n18. January 2007 |21:40\nThere are known and already fixed bugs in jQuery 1.1. The next release, 1.1.1, scheduled for this weekend, includes these fixes. The accordion runs fine with the latest revision.\nI uploaded both normal and packed builds of the latest revision here:http://joern.jquery.com/dist/\nPlease let me know about further problems.\n19. January 2007 |15:06\nThere seems to be an error with the animation in FF 2.0 - when I click on one of the titles the sub headings appear for a split second before animating into view. Look at my link here in FF to see what I mean - I have only edited your CSS slightly to fit in with my design:\nIt works fine in Safari. Is this just a bug with FF and if so is there any way round it? I?m using Jquery 1.1.\n20. January 2007 |11:30\nI looked at your page, but can?t reproduce the problem. Works perfect on FF 2 (on Windows).\n21. January 2007 |19:08\nIf anyone could help me with expanding functionality of this script with cookies (remembering states) + some switches to make predefined tabs collapsed/expanded by default.\nI?d like to have similar functionality to that of menu of this site:http://miejsca.org/\nI am willing to pay if needed and then share the code with everyone, please mail me at mikolaj-i [at] o2 . pl\n22. January 2007 |18:19\nThanks for looking at my site. I?m using FF 2 on Mac, so perhaps it?s just an issue with the Mac version. Good to know it?s fine on PC FF tho, most people I know use Safari on Mac so I?m not too worried about this.\n[...] For anyone using the Accordion menu plugin, or looking for it: Version 1.1 is out! This includes all bug fixes since the first release, update to jQuery 1.1, and an overhaul of the plugin page, including documentation. [...]\n[...] For a full-blown plugin solution with lots of options, look no further than Jörn Zaefferer?s Accordion Menu. But if you want to try some showing and hiding on your own, read on. [...]\n13. February 2007 |08:39\nWould it be simple to allow closing of an active element? That is, if you click on a header that?s already active, close it. Rather than do nothing.\nI can see in the code where this is checked (and then returns) but I?m not sure what code I should put here to trigger the ?close?. (or if it will mess everything else up.)\n13. February 2007 |09:56\n@Jason: Seems like there is more interest in that feature, I see what I can do about it. I?ll try to provide it via another plugin option.\nUpdate: Ok, its in! Set the ?alwaysOpen? setting to false, that allows you to close open elements.\n22. February 2007 |11:13\nI am having a problem with the accordion when is called inside a ?thickbox?.\nIf you select ?browse by category? underneath the search box you will see that the thickbox is calling an iframe where the accordion is displayed.In Firefox the accordion has all the elements expanded by default while in IE only the first one does.\nIt may be something to do with Iframe and Thickbox on Firefox because if you see the file on its own, it works fine:http://www.stockinthechannel.com/Categorylist.aspx\n22. February 2007 |21:16\nthat seems to be a rather weird problem. I couldn?t really find a hint at what?s going wrong there. You should take this to the jQuery mailing list, odds are quite good that someone there can help you.\n28. February 2007 |09:17\nGreat plugin, but is it possible to remove show/hide animation at all?\n28. February 2007 |19:33\nZigurds: I?ve added an animated option. Set it to false to disable animations.\nI?ve also fixed the alwaysOpen option, it should now work.\n[...] Accordion got the alwaysOpen option fixed (allowing you to close open accordion elements) and has now optional animations (were always used before).

March 2007 |20:12\nHi Jörn,maybe it?s my mistake I can?t figure out, but different name other than selected for active selector and its style doesn?t work for me. It always adds the default - selected. For example if I use active: ?div.something? it still adds selected for my style class, not something.\n6. March 2007 |21:25\nSorry, found out it myself - hadn?t specified selectedClass. But the thing I really can?t do now is to include more ps or divs inside the title div. Nothing happens if I click in places right where these other ps or divs are.Anyway, very nice plug-in.\n8. March 2007 |15:19\nHello, this is a nice plugin, thank youI?m trying to use it from a nested list, but I don´t need links at all, so I?d like to apply header to li with class ?head?, but this doesn?t work:\nIt works if I put any element inside li (span, a, hx), but it doesn?t work if I try it without extra markup. Am I missing anything or this extra markup is a must?ThanksP.s. Sorry for my poor English?\n8. March 2007 |23:40\n@AI: I think that can be fixed by applying the click handler to the header itself and all children. I just wonder why the click event isn?t bubbling up to the titel div itself. I?ll check that.\n8. March 2007 |23:45\n@Jaime: Could you post an example of your exact markup? I need to try that, so far the selectors were pretty flexible, maybe this is an example where they are not flexible enough.\n9. March 2007 |10:30\nYup, that?s the thing I was wondering too. It works fine if there is only text in header/title, but if there are another elements in it, the click doesn?t work on those elements, but still works on the header itself where are not these elements, like if the elements inside are smaller than the whole header.\n9. March 2007 |12:32\nHi Jörn, this is what does work:\nAnd this is what does not work:\n9. March 2007 |18:10\n@Jaime: Ok, that HTML snippet helped a lot. There is no way to get that working with the current Accordion, without great efforts on behalf of the plugin.\nBut it is very easy to fix the markup to get it working, the overhead is minmal:\nJust wrap the next ul into its own li.\nIs that acceptable for you?\n9. March 2007 |18:20\n@Ai: I figured out why that behaviour is happening. Its due to the implementation: It assigns a single click handler to the entire accordion container, instead of each element. The check for the clicked element has to consider the parents of the element.\nThat is an ugly drawback of the event delegation pattern.\nMaybe I?ll come up with a soltion, but its not very easy.\n9. March 2007 |18:49\nThat?s not a ?well formatted? (x)html nested list, so I think it?s better to use a span inside li as I did. It works as expected while the code still is valid (x)html.\n9. March 2007 |18:57\n@Jaime: I have to disagree. And just ran it through the validator, its perfectly valid XHTML 1.0 strict. Please consider that option again.\n9. March 2007 |21:04\nWell, It validates but that structure has got no sense to me. The list of items that belong to header1, should be inside of its container (li).In your example we have a list which first item is header1 (header of what, if it hasn?t got Childs?)The second item is an empty (no text) one with an ul inside (child of??), and so on. That?s not a good practice, and it doesn?t complain with the most basic rules of accessibility. It validates, but it?s invalid for millions? Of course that?s only my opinion, and I?m not a master in almost anythingThanks for all, JörnRegards from Spain\n9. March 2007 |21:15\nIs the trigger method configurable? i.e. I would like to use a mouseover instead of a mouse click to expand the menu. Is that possible?\n10. March 2007 |12:24\n@Jaime: The original accordion implementation was written with a definition list in mind. The unordered list we have here replicates the structure of that list, therefore it works without additional markup in the plugin.\nAs I don?t have any idea how the plugin could handle your first example, I can?t change that. I?d by happy to integrate whatever you may come up with.\n10. March 2007 |12:59\n@Eric: Added! Just released version 1.2 of the Accordion plugin, it now lets you customize the triggering event via the ?event? option. The second example in the demo shows it in action.\n11. March 2007 |12:29\nHi Jörn, is there an easy way to expand/collapse all items of the menu at once?Thanks!Jez.\n11. March 2007 |19:21\nHi again,I made a small amendment so that if you click an active head to collapse it, the class is reset to not selected. This allowed me to add ?twisties? as a background image - see my site for it in action.\nThere may be a more elegant way of doing this to the jQuery expert?\nI?m also using:$(?li.menuHighlight?).parents(?li?).children(?a.head?).addClass(?selected?);to select a head based on a child item being active (in this case has class menuHighlight). Might be useful to someone.\n12. March 2007 |11:26\n@Jez: The treecontroll is intended for expading/collapsing all at once. I?m sure it can be improved, but so far I don?t have any requests on that.\nI like that menu on your site. If you don?t mind, I?d take that as a reference and put it in the examples and improve the plugin to get that working with less effort.\nOne tip: Try to set show and hide speeds to the same value. That makes the movement more consistent and somehow nicer to watch.\n12. March 2007 |11:38\nI?m using Accordion 1.2 with jQuery 1.1.1 and I?m having the problem that the first content element of my accordion is always hidden when the page is loaded. It seems to be active in the sense that it cannot be activated either.\nI tried the definition list solution (which I prefer for its clean markup), but the problem also occurs with nested divs.\nWhen using .activate(1) the second content gets activated, but .activate(0) does not activate the first problem. Any ideas?\nMy html and code is:\nMachines and time seriesContent 1Filtering time seriesFilter options\n13. March 2007 |09:23\nIs it possible to have a fly out menu as well as an accordian menu?\nI have a site with a few levels of navigation and I don?t want two level fly out menus.\n13. March 2007 |11:24\nJörn - please help yourself. Email me if you need any more input. I think it works really well! Cheers.\n14. March 2007 |20:45\nHello,This is exactly what I have been looking for. I have been trying to implement this and I am running into a little problem. The problem is that the first node is not automatically expanding when the page is loaded. The ?header? is being assigned the ?selected? class so I know that it knows it should be shows. If I click the second item in the list to expand it and then click the first it expands as expected. The code I am using is below. (I am not sure how to make the code segment show up so I hope it looks right)\nand for the javascript:\nThank you very much,Tim\n16. March 2007 |18:02\n@Eric: What you describe sounds like a problem on your side, as that are the very basics of the accordion that work in all my tests. Still, I may have missed something. The best way to help you: Provide a test page that shows both your markup and your script.\n@Steven: Could you describe in more detail what you?d like to achieve? Are you referring to a menu as thejd_menudropdown style when talking about flyouts?\n@Jez: Thanks! Will do.\n@Tim: I can?t see anything with what came through the comment filter. Could you post a link to a seperate demo page? That makes finding the problem much easier.\n16. March 2007 |20:58\nFirstly, thank you very much for this sweet code. It?s much appreciated.\nSecondly, I?ve implemented your system for my left column site navigation using event: ?mouseover? to reveal a heading?s list on mouseover.\nI would like to know if there is any way of adding a delay, so that each heading does not immediately reveal its list but rather it reveals its list after a delay of a second or so.\nIs there any way of doing this? If there is, can you point me in the right direction?\nMany thanks for all your work!\n17. March 2007 |19:28\n@Sameer: Basically that requires adding a timer that is cleared on mouseout. That is not trivial to add to the current accordion code base.For reference, you could take a look at the tooltip plugin: It provides a delay before displaying the tooltip.\n19. March 2007 |03:09\nthanks for your reply. I will investigate?\n[...] It?s nothing fancy (yet) but can easily become very good-looking indeed. Take a look at the tiny Navigation Menu Example and judge for yourself. The example is based mainly on the jQuery plugin: Accordion, and the only main difference is the up and down arrows included in the ?slightly modified? CSS. [...]\n22. March 2007 |11:59\nI have the following problem with the accordion menu. When I click a button the submenu?s collapse but the link is not working. The a href is filled but it doesn?t work.\nCan anybody help me?\n22. March 2007 |16:56\nYou are trying to mix normal anchors with accordion headers, and that doesn?t work quite well. If you want to use the header link as normal AND open the accordion at the same time, you have to use a serverside-based accordion.\n24. March 2007 |18:27\nDoes your script provide a work-around if parent menu items have no child items? If so, the user must click twice to enter pages where there are no children. Thus in the URL above you must double-click to goto Contact Us page, etc.\n25. March 2007 |22:04\n@Cubefree: That is the same issue that Ad reported, and I don?t have a solution for it yet. Basically the problem is that you want a normal link as well as a trigger for the accordion.\nI?ll look for a workaround that disables the accordion behaviour for header elements that have no content, that should solve your particular problem.\n26. March 2007 |06:28\nJorn, Yes that is exactly what I need. By the way, a great script! I look forward to exploring your other scripts. Can you update this page regarding any plans you have to integrate with the Joomla CMS? Love your script, and after the client pays, I will most certainly donate to your labors, 25 Euros. Any furth coming solution to this problem is also worthy of an extra donation of 35 Euros. Dank je!\n26. March 2007 |23:26\nCan?t help you with Joomla. I?ll let you know once I find time and a way to fix the header-without-content problem.\n27. March 2007 |21:43\nUntil I get the chance to make a new release:\nChange the line 239 saying ?return false? to ?return !toShow.length?.\n[...] Another version of this type of sliding menu.

I run a win xp sp2 with a kaspersky win workstation antivirus on it (virus definition up to date). the thing is that it gives me the following virus alert: ?jquery.accordion.pack.js infected by virus: Trojan-Downloader.Js.Agent.ea?. could u give me a clue as to why this is happening? 10x\n3. April 2007 |20:31\nJorn, line change at 239, worked like a charm! Thank you.\nI have one other request. Curious, is it possible to make it so that if the user as already expanded a parent menu, then their next click on the parent menu item ignores the parent menu?s URL and only collapses the menu back down? PS. Client still has not paid, yet. But they are a University so they will\n3. April 2007 |20:49\n@andi: Seems like Kaspesky sees a virus in the compressed version. Either your virus software is better then mine or worse, I don?t get any virus warnings. And haven?t heard from anyone else about any.\n@Cubefree: I need a more detailed description of your problem, but it doesn?t sound to hard to implement.\n3. April 2007 |20:57\nJorn, so for example, if the user had opened the parent item, say? , then if they clicked the parent, People. It should close the menu, rather than go nowhere.\n4. April 2007 |19:35\nDid you notice any problem in IE6/7 if there is a <form> inside each part of the accordion?I?m running into problems when using a form: they doesn?t dissapear, overlaping any following content.\nPlease, can anyone confirm? Thanks in advance.\n4. April 2007 |19:48\n@Cubefree, and anyone else with the same problem: Setting the alwaysOpen option to false solves it.\n@Maniquí: I haven?t heard of any problems with that, but didn?t try it either. I?m pretty sure we can solve that once you can provide a test page.\n4. April 2007 |21:43\nHi Jörn. Thanks for your quick reply.It seems the problem is triggered in combination with jQuery Tabs (.tabs()).First time the tab (the one that includes the accordion) is loaded, the problem is triggered: the accordion doesn?t show properly.If I switch between tabs and go back to the ?problematic? tab, the accordion is fixed magically.\nSorry, I can?t provide a test page right now because I?m working in an admin side.\n4. April 2007 |22:16\nI?ve seen dozen times problems that were solved quite fast once a test page was available. And the problem you describe is not quite trivial, so I hope you manage to extract the problem into a small demo.\n4. April 2007 |23:37\nThanks again, Jörn. During the process of creating a small demo (I agree with you about solving problems by creating a minimal test page) I have isolated the problem.My fault (and IE6/7 fault, of course, too):\nIt seems that a position:relative applied to the <fieldset> element was causing the problem. Removing it fixed the problemAs said, switching between tabs (or totally disabling jquery.tabs) seemed to be the solution, that?s why I supposed it was a problem between your plug-in and .tabs() (I have to review my logical mechanics, I know).\nThanks again for your time (and for the plug-in, of course). Don?t hesitate in asking anything if you need/want to know more about this particular problem/solution.\n5. April 2007 |16:49\nWell, I?d still like to see the example page, the combination of tabs and accordion is interesting.\n5. April 2007 |17:21\nJörn, I?ve sent you an e-mail with a test page.\n6. April 2007 |23:01\nIs it possible to select otherwise than my index ?\neg I have an item $(?#entry12?) that I want to select in my accordion. Is it possible ?\n6.

Would it be possible to add an item with a link to the page or add it to the double click event or ? ?\nI?m not sure what would be the most user friendly way of not loosing that link. Any sugestion ?\n7. April 2007 |01:05\n@xavier: I?ll try to extend the activate() method so that you can pass an expression to activate the element.\nFor your other request: Doesn?t sound like you need a clientside accordion. If you want to open a page when clicking that link, just do it. The accordion can?t help you there.\n9. April 2007 |22:41\nIf you use a ul li structure for your accordion, you can let jquery add you ?head? class on the a :\njQuery(?#navmenu li > ul?).siblings(?a?).addClass(?head?).attr(?title?,\'Click to open, double click to access the page?);\n(the attr title is to add some explaination).\nAs to select per id, I tried (li_id being the id of the li I want to open):jQuery(?#li_id > a?).trigger(?click?)\nbut nothing.

April 2007 |18:34\n@jkopel: Could you provide a simple test page that shows your setup and what you?d like to do with it?

I?m not yet sure how difficult it would be to provide that functionality on top of the accordion. Maybe it needs another spinoff.\n11.

April 2007 |14:53\nActually, I need to add the class anyway, as I use it to display ?>? and ?v? icons.\nAs for being able to use the link on the head element, that?s taking shape, and Karl Swedberg found the solution to it.\nBasically, the idea is to duplicate the head as the first line (I?m using ul li as a structure)\n$(?#accordion a.head?).each(function() {var $cloned = $(this).clone();$(this).next(?ul?).find(?li:first?).prepend($cloned);});\njquery is really impressive? and the guys around it are quite something as well.

I?ll try to fix that.\n@api: Thanks for the link.\n14. April 2007 |10:56\n@Anwar: I?ve tried to add cookie-based statesaving to the treeview plugin but gave up at some point due to some really weird behaviour on different browsers. Basically it should be no big deal to add it to the accordion, saving you a lot of trouble on the serverside.\nFor the treeview, I tried to store the state on page unload. That seemed to work in FF and IE, but didn?t work at all in Opera. And at some point it also failed in FF and IE.\nI think the most realistich approach would be to provide statesaving for a single accordion on one page, and save the cookie on each click. The serialization would be very similar to the treeview, 0 for a didn?t-change-element, 1 for a changed-element. That way only changes that the user actually made are stored.\n[...] bassistance.de » jQuery plugin: Accordion (tags: jquery plugin accordion javascript) [...]\n16.

April 2007 |17:38\n@Lucas: For a start you have to remove all those duplicate IDs. With even one duplicate ID, the behaviour is totally undefined. You should be able to remove all those classes on the anchors, too. You should rewrite you add/remove selected:\n16.

April 2007 |18:05\n@Grover: You could hack it using the change event, but there isn?t official support yet.The good thing, the hack should be easy: The accordion doesn?t ?save? any special state, it justs shows and hides elements. So you can simply hide the right elements when something is changed in the other accordion.\n16.

April 2007 |20:35\n@Grover: You need the same selector that the accordion uses to show and hide the content elements:\nThat should do the trick.\n@Lucas: I?m not sure what you are up to, but as long as its working, it seems to be fine.\n17.

April 2007 |22:33\nThanks for replying so quickly Jörn,\nSorry to give you a bit of a panic!\nTurns out a script I added to create _blank links without un-validating my page was causing the issues:\n// Fetch all the a elements in the document.var links = document.getElementsByTagName(\'a\');\n// Loop through the a elements in reverse order// for speed.for (var i = links.length; i != 0; i--) {\n// Pull out the element for this iteration.var a = links[i-1];\n// If the element doesn?t have an href, skip it.if (!a.href) continue;\n// If the element has a className that contains// ?external? attach the onclick handler.if (!a.href.indexOf(?http:\\/\\/?) && a.href.indexOf(?http:\\/\\/blocklevel.co.nz?)) a.onclick = PopWin;\n// Accommodate IE?s non-standard event handling.if (!e) var e = window.event;var a = e.target ? e.target : e.srcElement;\n// Open a new window with the link?s href.var newwin = window.open(a.href);\n// The thought is that if the new window didn?t// (popups blocked or whatever) we want to return// true so the link is follow normally. Not sure// if this works, but it doesn?t seem to hinder.return !newwin;\nAs I said I?m not much of a scripter but my guess is that something in the second half which targets IE is causing the prob.\nIf you can see an easy way round it great, but I?m not fussed about changing the doctype and losing that script.\n18. April 2007 |10:43\nI think you should replace that script with a few simple lines of jQuery, something like this:\nUntested, but should work withot much further modifications. Eg. modify the href filter for you own domain.\n18. April 2007 |10:56\nThanks, turns out that swfObject was also causing issues. I?ve just re-written it to use ufo.js instead (passing variables to the flash and bypassing the IE activex block if using the jQuery flash embed seemed a bit too complex)? hopefully this works.\nI don?t have access to a PC here at home so will test on IE tomorrow morning and let you know how I go.\nThanks again for all your help\n18. April 2007 |17:47\nI?m trying to use it in a step-wise situation where the user must complete a step at a time before being able to move to the next step.\nOnce a step has been completed, the user can return to it to edit it, but they can?t move beyond where they?ve already been without taking some action (answering a question, for example).\nIs there a way to dynamically enable/disable the accordion headers?\n18.

April 2007 |09:51\nOh, my code didn?t show up, (turned into a link), but you know what I mean.\n20. April 2007 |10:36\nIs there something I can do to keep the accordion open when a nested item is clicked rather than closing, so that it only closes when you chose another header item?\nSeefor what I mean. The nested list needs to stay open so that all the sub-items can be seen if the user then choses another sub-item, until another parent item is clicked.\n23. April 2007 |03:02\nI am trying to use the example for list3 with the underlined titles. The code is based on the id of the div though, I would like to have say 20 of these but each with a unique id, how can I do this?\n23. April 2007 |16:30\nI also have the same need as Enrico, for the nested items to stay open until another header is chosen. I am using the list4 example, so this is a navigation list. I noticed Jez?s site is doing what I need mine to do, but I can?t recreate it.\n23. April 2007 |19:01\n@Enrico: By default, the active header gets a ?selected? class assigend. You can use either that class or change it via the ?selectedClass? option.\n@Enrico & Nichole: For that you need either some serverside logic that marks the clicked menu as active, or cookie-based statesaving, which isn?t implemented yet.\n@Marc: I don?t quite get what you need, can you post a demo page?\n5. May 2007 |09:17\nIs it possible to have more than one section of the accordion open at the same time?\nI guess it would be more like a ?click the heading to open and close this section? and clicking it wouldn?t effect any other sections.\nWe?re already using accordion for another part of the site (works a charm!) so I?m hoping to use it again instead of adding more Ks to the site weight via custom code and/or additional plugins.\n5. May 2007 |12:11\n@Will: The accordion does a great job at not allowing more then one section open at a time. Its really difficult to make it undo that and allow more then one. Until I figure out a better solution, please give?Squeezebox?a try. Its mostly the same as the accordion, but with the behaviour you need. Let me know if that works for you.\n10.

May 2007 |20:36\n@Jason: Are you using a specific interface plugin or just all of them?\n10. May 2007 |21:21\nI?m using the scroll effect. I downloaded one version with only the Scroll Effect and then I tried one with the entire Effects package (not Standalone or Mouse) and I got the same error with both.\nWhen I removed Accordion, the ScrollTo worked fine, and when I removed Interface, the accordion worked fine.\nI also tried loading Interface first, thinking perhaps something was being redefined, but it didn?t matter which one loaded first.\n10. May 2007 |21:43\nOk, thanks for the report. I?ll try to fix it.\n11. May 2007 |10:43\nIs there any possibility to get a class instead of the display: none?\n11. May 2007 |20:05\nJorn, squeezebox worked a charm. Thanks!\n13. May 2007 |11:55\n@usp: No, that isn?t possible. Could you give me a concrete example how you would use that?\n28. May 2007 |00:26\nAnother problem with Accordion+Interface.\nEverything was working great until I did a full SVN update of JQuery and Interface today. When Interface is included *after* Accordion, accordion stays all open (i.e. none of the panels are collapsed). Moving Interface above Accordion fixes Accordion, but breaks the Slider plugin in Interface. This is with the full Interface plugin.\n28. May 2007 |21:58\n@RF: Thanks for reporting. I haven?t made any attempts yet to integrate Interface with my plugins. I?ll try to fix it, and contact the Interface authors if necessary.\n2. June 2007 |12:27\nI?m getting the error ?0.tagname? is null or not an object when running script in ie7. Works fine in firefox. I?m using the following code:\njQuery().ready(function(){jQuery(?#sub_nav?).Accordion({header: ?div.trigger?,active: false,alwaysOpen: false});});\nAny help would be most welcome\n5. June 2007 |01:13\nHi, and thank you for this fantastic function!\nI?m trying to use the accordion for a pretty old web shop?s category tree, and by some nesting I have managed to get it working as far as loading all the parameters the right way.I use 3 accordions with 3 ID?s - etc. One for the top level, one for the second level and one for the third level, that?s how deep it goes.\nThe list is produced as I expect, with the right class for the categories and subcategories that contain deeper content, and excluding the ones that doesn?t go any deeper and all is fine.\nBut, it is only the top level and the first top categorys sub-items and third items that actually works. I am guessing it has to do with the duplicated ID?s for second and third levels? Is there any way to work around this? Or is there some other problem?I?m thankful for any help. The url for demo of this error is:http://www.bluescap.com/nst/test2.php\n5. June 2007 |06:36\njquery.accordion.js should add ->\n6. June 2007 |17:03\n@Goodmixer: Could you post an example page?\n@Torgil: Yeah, you?ve got a lot of duplicated IDs, thats a big problem. I recommend to add classes to those sublists (like ?level1?, ?level2? and use those classes to select the specifc levels. You could also avoid those classes and use more specific selects (eg. ?ul>ul?, ?ul>ul>ul?).\n@sun: That function is on the demo page for the sole porpose of demonstrating how to use the change-event.\n6. June 2007 |20:37\nHello again Jörn.I replaced the ID?s with level specific classes to trigger the accordions, and it works like clockwork!\nThank you for the help, I really appreciate you taking time to do it.\n11. June 2007 |17:09\nJust wanted to say thanks for this great plugin, and wondering if you managed to achieve the ?horizontal accordion? that API asked for.\n11. June 2007 |21:50\n@Sergio: Thanks. No, currently there is no progress on that topic.\n12. June 2007 |17:59\nGreat plugin. I have it functioning well, but have a quick question:\nI?m using the nested UL version, when you click on a header box it expands the list below it. If the original LI that is the header has a link in it you have to click on the link a second time to get it to open that page.\nMine currently functions identical to the last one on the demo page (Navigation - Unordered List with anchors and nested lists). If you click the List 2 Header it expends, but you have to click the List 2 text link a second time activate the link.\nIs it possible to have it do both functions with one click:ex: Open the acordion menu below the header selected and active the text hyperlink within the header LI element?\n12. June 2007 |20:27\n@Jason: That issue came up before, but I still don?t have a good solution for it. Karl Swedberg came up with the idea to clone the anchor and put it as the first item in the nested list.\n12. June 2007 |23:38\nLove your plugin! I have a problem similar to Jasons. I (mostly) solved it by binding an load() ajax call to the headers. So the the box expands and the page info (info only, no page reload loosing the current accordion state) gets loaded. (seehttp://www.ehs.sfu.ca/research\nBUT I just had an idea: Is it possible to use hoverIntent with your plugin? that would solve the too trigger happy menu using ?onmouseover? while keeping the link clickable?..\nMy JavaScript fu is not exactly strong, hence the request?.\n13. June 2007 |08:52\n@Angelo: I guess I really need to give hoverIntent a shot. It seems like it can be combined with every plugin of mine?\n14. June 2007 |01:34\nI read on one of your previous posts (to Anwar on April 13) about state saving. You mentioned that you?ve attempted using the page unload event to pass the state and had some luck in IE and FF - could you post an example of how you did that? I need to be able to save state without cookies and simultaneously allow for sublevels of navigation. Thanks for the sweet plugin!\n14. June 2007 |18:03\n@Liz: Actually I experimented with cookie-based state-saving and the treeview plugin. Though if I get one to work, the other should be easy. An alternative to cookie-based state-saving would be ajax-requests, which of course requires much more work on the serverside. Would that help you somehow?\n14. June 2007 |21:33\nThanks for getting back to me. I need to be able to do this without serverside scripting if at all possible (that would make my life too easy). Would the page unload event be a possibility, or will this absolutely require either state saving w/cookies or server-side scripting. Thanks again.\n14. June 2007 |22:49\nYou need one of both. The unload event was just used to trigger saving, though that didn?t work at all in Opera and very buggy in other browsers. A third alternative is using a flash movie, though that is even more obtrusive, but provides much more space to save data.\n18. June 2007 |17:58\nThanks Jörn - I?ll pass the word on. Have you found a way to provide ?n? sublevels of navigation, meaning, allowing for any number of levels of subnavigation with a single class?\n18. June 2007 |18:41\nHi again, Jörn -\nHow about this. How would i go about setting the active element based on an id in the body tag. For example, if the the active element would be hard-coded with a corresponding class, ?one?.\n18. June 2007 |22:49\n@Liz: There wasn?t any intention for accordions with sublevels, so currently I can?t provide an easy solution. If you know how many sublevels there are, you can use the child selector, eg. for three levels this could work:\nI don?t understand your based-on-id-in-body tag question. Could you detail that, or put together an example page? It doesn?t sound impossible\n19. June 2007 |14:47\nThanks - instead of using the body tag id, what about setting the active option in accordion to something like:\n$(?#nav a[@href$=\"\' + path + \'\"]?)\nWhere, var path = location.pathname.substring(1) ?\nIs it possible to do something like that?\n19. June 2007 |22:17\nIf I get that right: You use the accordion for page-navigation. You want it to display the current page as active, based on the current location and the href of anchors inside the accordion.\n20. June 2007 |17:41\nCorrect - and if that?s set in the active property in the accordion options, wouldn?t that expand the accordion items accordingly, i.e. saving state (sort of)?\n20. June 2007 |18:58\n@Liz: Yeah, sort of. I like the idea, and it should work for every navigation menu, because the association between current location and href is very flexible.\n21. June 2007 |02:16\nI was trying to get this to work but am probably just having syntax issues:\nvar path = location.pathname.substring(1)\njQuery(?#list?).Accordion({header: ?div.title?,active: ?#list li a[@href$=\"\' + path + \'\"]?\nAny suggestions? Thanks a bunch!\n21. June 2007 |20:21\n@Liz: I guess your selector doesn?t work due to the way jQuery?s not() method works. I?ve tried a similar example that worked, so your approach should be ok. Try it with this:\n23. June 2007 |07:37\nI?m didn?t realised the svn version contains an option to activate by passing a reference to the method. Life saver !\nFor those who look, that?s what I did (accordion on the top of a ul li) to activate the li #ref:\njQuery(?#ref?).parent().activate( ?#ref} > a? );\n24. June 2007 |02:02\ndein plugin ist echt guad.aber es zuckt ein wenig während des raus- und reinfahrens.fährt also nicht so smooth wie z.b. hier:http://www.apple.com/mac/kann man da was machen?grüsse, tobi\n24. June 2007 |13:13\n@xavier: I?ll try to release that revision soon.\n@tobe: Am Plugin selber lässt sich da kaum was machen, da einfach nur die Animationen von jQuery verwendet werden. Allerdings werden Animationen in jQuery 1.1.3 deutlich verbessert, und das müsste sehr bald fertig sein.\n25. June 2007 |17:55\nThanks so much. I?ve given your example a shot, but no luck. Maybe it?s because of the way I have my ul?s set up inside of a div? Take a look:https://iris.cair.du.edu/webteam/jQuery/menu/index.htm\n25. June 2007 |21:26\n@Liz: Thanks for the link, that helps a lot. I see where the trouble lies. Currently only header elements are checked ?to be active?. Though the location points to a child of those. That needs a little bit more sophisticated filtering, which can be difficult with jQuery not()-implementation. I?ll give it a try.\n27. June 2007 |09:30\nHi Jorn,I have a problem with the accordion in IExplorer but only when it is placed under a flash movie that is placed with the swfObject.js method. Do you know if swfObject.js causes some problem?? Here you can see the accordion working right and not in the same page (when you reload the page in IE 6 it works wrong and show the message problem with 0.tagName):\nThanks for your help\n27. June 2007 |17:52\nHello Jörn,I?m trying to make the accordion fill full height of the window as side nav panel. Problem is when I set the DD height to 100%, it becomes to high (as it includes 100% of the DD + heading DTs). DL?s height does?t affct accordion?s height at all (sadly). Do you have any solution for this?\n28. June 2007 |09:52\n@Blanca: Some reported that issue before, but without an example page. That should help fixing it, thanks. I?ll look into it.\n@Matej: Full-height layouts are always tricky. I?m not sure yet how exactly you want to have it. Should everything scale to full height? Or just the accordion-container? More details, an example, whatever you can provide, all helps.\n28. June 2007 |15:04\nAny luck with getting the filtering for the active header / child elements issue? Thanks so much for taking look.\n28. June 2007 |16:48\nLook at. I want the accordion to have its topmost header on the top of the page (it is okay) and its bottommost headers by the bottom of the window.\nI guess it will need some sort of JS height calculations. I can attampt to do it; I just ask if you don?t know about any simplier solution.\n1. July 2007 |10:33\nIs it possible to have accordions inside other accordions?\nMy idea is to create a navigation with more than one level.\nI?m trying this js code but it is not working:\nSince I have more than one subnav I?m using a class for that.\n1. July 2007 |12:58\n@Liz: No, not yet.\n@Matej: I see. That looks like very hard if not impossible to achieve with pure CSS.\nThe change-event triggered by the accordion should be right place to perform the necessary calculations.\n@Moises: In theory that should work. Could you post the code as an example page? The HTML got messed up by the comment system.\n2. July 2007 |22:28\nI have a solution multi level that works (3 levels, based on ul lists). Only problem to solve on ie7 (has someone experienced problem with ie7).\nI?ll publish as soon as I?ve been able to fix it.\n[...] An update to the jQuery accordion plugin brings you, among minor bugfixes and a demo overhaul, one notable new feature: The navigation-option automatically activates a part of the accordion based on the current location (URL) of the page. The basic idea came up in the comments on the plugin page and was at first implemented in Bernd Matzner?s HoverAccordion. The basic idea is the same: Find the anchor in the navigation accordion that matches location.href and mark it as selected and open the part of the accordion where it is inside. This gives you a sort of state-saving without the need to generate ?selected?-classes on the serverside. [...]\n9. July 2007 |20:44\nJörn. I discovered that the error I was getting was caused by using swfobject and no fault in the code. I do however have another question.\nIs it possible to have a link in a seperate block of content open or change state of one of the sections of the accordian?\n10. July 2007 |18:08\n@Goodmixer: Yep. That is the purpose of the activate-method. There are three examples on this page under ?activate? and some stuff on the demo page (though currently only in page code). Let me know if that helps.\n11. July 2007 |03:45\nWhen trying to add the accordion menu to a nested layout the #navigation div is being set to hidden when you click any of the accordian links in FireFox.\nHas anyone else had this problem?\n11. July 2007 |13:28\n@Michael: Could you provide a test page for that issue? Would help a ton to solve it.\n12. July 2007 |23:12\n@Blanca: I found a the same issue with SWFObject and IE. It seems to work if you execute the SWFObject code at the bottom of the page (below the accordian code)\n13. July 2007 |07:51\nIs it me or is the close function not working?\nAlso the close example isnt working for me.\n13. July 2007 |10:10\n@uffa: Thanks, I?ll add a note on that in the docs.\n@cage: You need to set alwaysOpen: false for that to work. Let me know if that doesn?t work either.\n16. July 2007 |01:15\nI had a question about activating a menu by name, but I?ve Figured it out myself, here?s what I?ve done\nfirst label each submenu (in my case a ?ul?) with an identifying class or ID ? in my case I?ve used a class.\nthen to activate a menu item by name use this code.\n16. July 2007 |11:10\nHi Jörn, thanks for this splendid plugin. Probably worth noting that it raises an error when your jquery selector returns no elements to apply the Accordion to. (For instance $(?DL?).Accordion() will error when there are no DL elements.)I noticed this when I had generic script on several pages to apply the Accordion, but some pages did not need it.Workaround is $(?DL?).each(function(){ $(this).Accordion() });Cheers,George\n17. July 2007 |17:41\n@Murray: activate also supports an expression, so basically this should also work:\nThe expression is evaluated in the context of the accordion container (here: #mainNav).\n@George: Thanks for the comment. That is a servere mistake on my side, and I should really fix that as soon as possible. Somehow I managed to note but still ignore it.\n19. July 2007 |05:36\nHi, I am desperately trying to implement this into my Wordpress blog. Can someone please tell me in the simplest and easiest way to do this?\nI know nothing at all about this stuff. I basically just need someone to tell me what to do.\nWould anyone or the owner of this site be nice enough to help? I will e even pay you if you want.\n19. July 2007 |11:07\nHi Jörn, please: a short additional explanation of the navigation option.I understand, I have to add ? navigation: true?, but what about?location.href == ?? Do I fill in the URL of the actual page where I want the submenu to open? Why does your example point to a submenu (fantasy)?Vielen Dank im vorausGerhard\n24. July 2007 |13:44\n@Eli: You should start to include necessary files (jQuery and the plugin) into your theme. For this site the theme is athttp://bassistance.de/wp-content/themes/tonus/. Just add the two script elements to header.php.\nOnce you?ve got that you need to find or create the HTML you want to transform into the accordion. If you could provide a few more details, eg. an example, I could give you some more detailed hints.\n@Gerhard: The navigation options assumes a 1:1 mapping from URL of the current page to an anchor in the accordion. And currently it works only for nested lists, just like in the example. You don?t have to set location.href in JavaScript, just click on a link to go to that page.\n24. July 2007 |15:34\nCongratulations from Argentina. Awesome!! Thanks and good luck ^^\n24. July 2007 |18:33\n24. July 2007 |18:33\nI have found a bug though.. when you have an accordion inside another accordion, you click a panel (one that is inside your child accordion) to make it show, if you click it again it?ll close both accordions, even if you have alwaysOpen: true\n24. July 2007 |22:38\nThank you for this great script.I have had no problem getting it to work.My only question is, can you make it where I can change a setting to allow it to open up versus opening down?\nOther then that, great job!!\n24. July 2007 |22:45\nJorn, excellent work. I?ve tried reading through the comments to trouble shoot this myself, but to no avail. Basically, I?ve add event ?mouseover? to my .head items that need to expand, and be clickable links, which works wonderfully. I?m also trying to use the navigation set to true, which also works wonderfully, for all of the subpages of the .head classed list. However, the top level pages, ie /parent/ the entire navigation disappears. Meaning, /parent/child/ works fine, /parent/ no list at all. Is there something I?m doing wrong? If navigation is set to false, this works flawlessly. Thank you so much.\n24. July 2007 |22:58\nMaybe I asked that wrong, i am not looking to make the links go above the header. I am looking to keep the header on top, but for the links to push the header up as the links come out.\n24. July 2007 |23:47\nI sorta see where the problem lies. It?s got to do with the URL handling with prevailing/trailing slashes. I?m using WordPress and permalinks, so my urls are /parent/ /parent/child/. If I remove the prevailing slash, then things sorta work in FF, but the URL handling is wonky.\nIf I use parent/ /parent/child/ then it works well enough, just the parent/ page doesn?t expand the sub-section. The effect is much closer to what I want, but ideally, I?d like to be able to expand the sub-section if clicking the parent page. I hope this makes sense. I can email you the URL to the site I?m working on if that would help, and provide the code I?m using.\nRegardless, I must say you are a shining example of the word community, not only for sharing your code, but your well documented site, examples, and code. Thank you.\n25. July 2007 |06:13\nim using ajax to load the content of each ?tab?. but sometimes the content should be updated without choosing another tab. So i used alwaysOpen = false to make this module read the active() method. But the tab collapse, as expected.\nwell, there is a way to make .active() work on a already opened tab? If not, i suggest to implement the feature.\ngreat great plug in!\n25. July 2007 |17:40\n@Michael: I never tried to include one accordion inside another, therefore its not really surprising that is doesn?t work flawless. I?ll give it a try myself, though a demo page from yours would help a lot.\n@Kyle: I already switched from using slideUp/Down to animate() (in SVN), therefore changing the direction shouldn?t be too difficult. But there are more issues related to that. If you work with position:absolute for your accordion it may work.\n@miklb: That sounds like a bug. A link to your page is welcome, even better would be a testpage that just includes the interesting parts. Thanks for those kudos!\n@massa: I haven?t fully grasped what your setup looks like, but it sounds like it should be possible to fix the issue. Could you provide a testpage, that?d make it much easier. Thanks.\n25. July 2007 |19:25\nthanks for responding. using yourexamples, the second list is using the mouseover to expand. Mouse over guitar, click it, and it loads ?p1.1.1.1 when you mouse away from the nav list, the whole box disappears.In my case, I?m using /parent/ and /parent/child/ hrefs. If I remove the prevailing slash from the parent, meaning parent/ and /parent/child/ then the navigation works as planned, *except* that because I?m leaving off the prevailing slash, if I click on /parent/child/ then on second-parent/ the URL is /parent/child/second-parent/ which then is a broken URL. I don?t know of a way to show an example, but if you?d like to see the working site, I can email the link to you.\nagain, I appreciate your time.\n27. July 2007 |15:24\n@miklb: Thanks, that example is fine and should be enough to fix the problem.\n27. July 2007 |15:25\nThank you for an excellent plugin. I enjoy using it and in general find it easy to use. I have a question though: I am trying to create a ?drawer? style accordion like the one onhttp://www.apple.com/mac/- look for Mac@work in the lover left corner.\nThe effect I am trying to achieve is to use the accordion effect on the image element and always show the link text below. My markup would then be something like:\nDo you have any experience with this type of accordion or do you have any hints on how to solve this challenge?\nAny help is highly appreciated!\n27. July 2007 |15:33\nOoops - the HTML didn?t make it through. Here is a link the the markup:http://www.itu.dk/people/mikaelm/accordion/AccordionMarkup.html\n28. July 2007 |09:48\n@Mikael: That is definitely a nicely designed accordion. It should be possible to replicate it using this plugin, but its not trivial. Haven?t tried it yet.\n28. July 2007 |13:31\nThanks for the quick answer. I would definitely like to give it a shot. But I need a few hints. Would you be able to provide a few hints?\nI think it would be a nice and cool feature to add to your plugin.\n28. July 2007 |19:53\nHi Jorn I have an example for you regarding flash objects and the js\nIndex page (works fine on load)\nthen (90% of the time not working) on a detail page\nCommenting the flash objects corrects the problem. Any ideas? I?m not using swfObject.js, they?re just straight object tags\n29. July 2007 |01:59\njust curious if you?ve had a chance to look at my issue. thanks.\n29. July 2007 |08:29\nJorn, moving jquery, the accordion and the script below the object tags fixed this problem.\n29. July 2007 |09:43\n@Mikael: For a start, try to set up the proper HTML structure and add classes where appropiate. Where are they appropiate? Just apply the accordion plugin to the structure and find a header-selector that gets it working.\n@Ryan: Thanks for the report. That is a weird problem, but its good that there is a solution available, well, at least a workaround.\n@miklb: No, not yet.\n31. July 2007 |16:19\nany suggestions on where I might look to fix this. I?d be glad to make a donation or something if you could help me with this issue.\n1. August 2007 |02:24\nFirst of all, congratulations on this great plugin for jQuery. A quick question, though: is it possible to have a fixed-height accordion with it?\nI see there is no optional parameter to do this, and I don?t really like the way everything below the accordion moves when it is resizing. This happens with other accordion libraries, too.\nDo you think there could be a way of setting a height somewhere so the accordion would maintain it?s height? We might need to play with overflows on the CSS, but I have a feeling this might be possible.\n1. August 2007 |15:47\nAccordion is great thanks. I?m trying to write some javascript to expand all the containers at the same time. In March you said that:\n> The treecontroll is intended for expading/collapsing all at once\nDoes that mean that Treecontrol works with Accordion, or that it?s only possible in Treecontrol and not in Accordion.\n3. August 2007 |16:16\n@miklb: I?ve commited a fix for that problem, please givethe latest revision a try\n@Marcelo: That is mostly a CSS issue. Giving the container a fixed height stops the rest of the page from moving. For that to be really useful to plugin would have to calculate the correct height. But as long as you set a fixed height for each content and the total, it works quite well. Something that also helps there is a linear animation, the latest revision (see above) contains a fix for that, too.\n@Alex: No, treecontrol and accordion are completely seperated. You can use the activate-method (see docs) to open parts of the accordion, though until now I haven?t found an acceptable approach to support opening all parts of the accordion.\n4. August 2007 |04:10\nI?ll give that a try. Just a heads up: you linked to the https repository url, which asks for login and password. I used the http url, though, and everything went ok.\nI?ll give the linear animation a go.\n4. August 2007 |21:48\nHi, Jörn.First of all thanks for this great Plugin. But I got a Problem: Everything worked fine locally, but when I moved my Site online, the accordion menu was fully expanded when the page loaded. If hit the Refresh Button on my Browser Safari), everything is fine (collapsed). Any Idea?Seems to be a ?Safari only? problem, everything works fine on FF & Opera on the Mac.\n5. August 2007 |08:59\ni didn?t know if you prefer to get feature requests here or on the jQuery list?\ni just started using the plugin today and i?m now your newest fan.Here are my suggestions for improving the plugin:\n1) The ?active? option should take an integer, to make it symmetric with the activate() method, which takes an integer. Likewise, activate() should accept all arguments which ?active? accepts (String|jQuery|Boolean|Element). This should be trivial to achieve by refactoring the ?active? handling code into the activate() method, and then implementing ?active? in terms of activate().\n2) IMO, setting showSpeed:0 or hideSpeed:0 should be the same as setting animated:false. In practice it makes little sense to have different hide/show speeds (it looks horrible), and i would highly recommend moving that to a single option, animationSpeed, or simply ?speed?. Also, during initialization, if the user only specifies one OR the other (but not both), then the other should be set to that value. e.g. passing {showSpeed:?slow?} should also set hideSpeed:?slow? and passing {hideSpeed:3000} should set showSpeed:3000. Currently, the user must specify neither of them or both of them, even though they will always be set to the same values (well, they will if the user is sane).\n5. August 2007 |22:47\n@Ben: I never tested in Safari. Could you give me at least a version number?\n@Stephan: I read all comments are, but currently lost track of the discussion list, so comments are preferred, though I need an alternative on the long term. Anyway?\n1) Great suggestions! Will do!\n2) Sounds good, too. I already experimented with linear animations (in constrast to the default swing easing), which give a much better behaviour. How about a single option, lets say ?speed?: 0 or false to disable animations, a number to indicate speed in milliseconds, or a string (slow/fast/normal).\n5. August 2007 |22:52\nI?m using the latest Beta Version of Safari 3.0.3 (522.12.1). Maybe it?s just some Beta trouble?\n6. August 2007 |01:38\nJorn, that actually didn?t work. On thetest exampleI provided, the section stays open completely now. On my test site, it doesn?t open on mouseover.\nI sincerely appreciate you taking time, and please, if you have a donation link, please provide it.\n6. August 2007 |16:45\n@Ben: I see, lets hope it doesn?t behave completely different on windows then on the mac. I?ll give it a shot.\n@miklb: Right. There is a script error on that page, though I don?t know what is causing that, the exception doesn?t help.\n6. August 2007 |17:37\nthe only change I made to that test was to upload the js file you linked to.\n7. August 2007 |09:18\nFollowing code worked with Accordion 1.3 but failed in IE6 with Accordion 1.4 :\nAnd JS :$(?.Show_hide?).Accordion({active: false,alwaysOpen: false,showSpeed: ?slow?,hideSpeed: ?slow?});\nIn Accordion 1.4 and IE6 all items are open and not one does show/hide.I addadheader: ?.Show_item?to the Accordion options to get it working under IE6 .Any thoughts why ? Works as designed or ?. !??\n7. August 2007 |09:24\nPff, all html marked up gone - here it is without the &lt and &gt :\ndiv class=?Show_hide?h3 class=?Show_item first?

And maybe also update jQuery.\n@Cees: I?m not sure what went wrong there. Could you also givethe latest revision a try? Please note that I?ve simplified the options, so instead of setting both showSpeed and hideSpeed, you can now set just animted: ?slow?.\n7. August 2007 |17:52\nI uploaded the version of accordian and jquery that you have in your repo, and now everything stays open, no collapse at all. Anything else change that I need to adjust in the code?\nMy previous demo site is still live with the new files.\n7. August 2007 |18:01\nHey! I downloaded the the zip of the repo, replaced all the files and changed the code in the head, and it works as expected. Fantastic! Perhaps removing the alwaysOpen made the difference?\nThank you very much for you work on this. Let me know if there?s anything I can do for you, I?ll keep monitoring this page regardless.\n7. August 2007 |19:30\n@miklb: Hmm, okayI?d definitely like to see the result of your work, if that is possible. I hardly get to see usages of my plugins in the wild.\n7. August 2007 |19:50\nIf you send me an email address, I?d be glad to send the link. I?d rather not post it publicly, it?s not my personal site.\nYeah, I realized I didn?t update the test sitesorry\n8. August 2007 |14:24\nFirst of all, thanks for this great tool.Unfortunately I encountered a problem: in IE the I get an error if there is a HTML comment tag in the code\n<div id=\"accordionTest\"><!? simple comment ?><h3><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\">A</a></h3><p>Hello</p><h3><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\">B</a></h3><p>World</p></div>\nHow can I solve this?\n8. August 2007 |19:00\nGreat plugin. Just one problem I?m seeing with the demo and my implementation with the navigation on FF. When clicking on the last ?head? the list opens at a greater height then adjust it?s self. This causes a bounce effect in FF. Any suggestions on how to open the last list item without this effect?\n8. August 2007 |22:44\nCan someone please help me i uploaded the new jquuery but i cannot seem to get it to work just right, if you look at the site. The navigation menu always goes back to the original element and it stays open it doesnt leave open the navigation menu that they just selected. What can i do\n8. August 2007 |23:01\nWhich file am i supposed to put the following code in:\njQuery(?#navigation?).Accordion({ active: false, header: ?.head?, alwaysOpen: false, navigation: true });\nMy goal is to use example two in the demo.\n9. August 2007 |18:20\nHey Jörn,the Safari Bug is really a Beta Problem. The Plugin is working fine in the latest stable version of safari, at least the part I use.\nYour example at the top of the page:\njQuery(?#nav?).Accordion({header: ?.head?,navigation: true});location.href == ?somedomain.com/movies/fantasy/?\ndoesn?t work for me, because I?m using the plugin in a cms, so I got no static content. Is there the possibility to check the url (I?m using clean url like the example) itself like in this case, if ?fantasy? is somehow in the url -> navigation:true?\nSorry, I?m not a hardcore js-coder. Do have any idea?\n10. August 2007 |03:03\nI am experiencing an issue with the accordion plugin being used with a form, when viewed with IE 6 and IE 7 and I?m hoping someone here may know what the problem is. I have created a simple page to hopefully demonstrate:\nWhat is the subject?s gender?\nWhat is the subject?s dominant hand?\nThe issue is that the first radio button of each set on the page should be checked (as you can see they have checked=?checked? set) and in Firefox, they are. But in IE 6 and IE 7 they are not checked no matter what I do. If I disable the accordion and view the page again in IE, they are checked as expected. So this would lead me to believe that there is some kind of incompatibility between jquery/accordion plugin and how IE handles radio buttons (and possibly checkboxes but I haven?t tested checkboxes).\nAny idea what?s going on here? Any help much appreciated. And sorry for the long post, I just wasn?t sure where else to post.\nI hate IE so much.\n10. August 2007 |03:07\nOh, sorry it appears that the HTML I posted in the previous comment didn?t make it through. Fair enough.\nBut even without my example page this issue should be pretty easy to replicate. All the page had on it was an accordion with two sections, and a set of radio buttons in each section, the simple issue being that when the radio buttons are viewed with the accordion in IE, IE appears to ignore the checked=?checked? attribute.\nIf any further information is required, I?m only too happy to give it as I am very interested in solving or finding a good work around for this issue.\n10. August 2007 |05:17\nFurther investigation into my issue seems to indicate that having a single form spanning across multiple accordion sections is what causes the radio button issue in IE 6/7. if I give each accordion section its own separate form, IE appears to work as expected? Which means I will likely have to re-write half the work I?ve done over the last 3 days just to accommodate IE?s ?excentricity?. Yay, why did I become a web developer again?\n10. August 2007 |10:22\nTried with CVS version - no luck - still all items open in IE6 when loading page and show/hide also does not work = class selected is correctly applied when clicking on header but no action follows.\n10. August 2007 |11:06\n@Xscratch: That is weird. No idea yet, but I?m gonna look into it.\n@jseg: I?m working on that behaviour.\n@Angel: Just put it somewhere on your page, inside a $(document).ready(function() { ? }) block.\n@Ben: Sorry about the stupid example. I just wanted to illustrate how the navigation-option worked, but failed utterly. There is nothing you have to do then set up a list of links. If you click one of them, the browser goes to that page, therefore the value for location.href changes. And the accordion plugin reads that value, can therefore find the clicked link and opens that accordion part. I think its important to know what happens, but you don?t have to actually code anything for it to work.\n@Cees: Could you post a test page?\n11. August 2007 |14:24\nThanks a lot. I should just have tested it. My Bad.Works perfect.\n12. August 2007 |22:10\nAnother vote for a ?save state?- I?m implementing the Accordion on a few WordPress themes and have some ideas for using conditionals to set the states, but for those without server side experience, a cookie based state would be awesome.\nKeep up the great work!\n13. August 2007 |16:08\nVery nice plugin. Just one really minor issue: I display the accordion on most pages which is why I have included it in my main js file. Unfortunately on the few pages where I do not have the accordion I get an error aboutjQuery(?:first-child?, this)[0] has no propertieshttp://karzoo.local/beta/js/jquery.accordion.jsLine 174\nThe reason for this is quite clear as the element that I have attached the accordion to does not exist on these pages and thus there is no html element in [0]. I have just added an extra check around the call of the accordion which works fine, but most of the other jquery plugins simply don?t do anything if the element does not exist. It would be nice if accordion could do the same.\nNevertheless - thanks for the good work.\n13. August 2007 |16:23\nHi Jörn,I have the same problem as jseg regarding animated=true in FF,but I have a bit more info!\nIn FF, if you expand any item -apart from the first(?!)- you will see that it first expands to a *double size* list, after which it contracts to the correct size. In IE it works perfect, very smooth?!\n13. August 2007 |22:46\nRegarding the FF flickering. That seems to be a jQuery slideToggle problem.Changing the to nested seems to solve my FF problems, so that?s a good work around.\nand in the css#nav a { display:block; }\n16. August 2007 |09:34\nOne simple question but i can not get my head arround it : printing a page with an accordion on it. I like the complete accordion to be open when the print is made - all items visible but i do not like the user to first open all items and then print the page.Is it possible to use the ?normal? print function of the browser and then print out the page with all items open ?!? I have tried with a media=print css stylesheet but the display:none is invoked by the accordion-js and can not be overruled - afaik.-Cees\n16. August 2007 |14:51\nI didnt read all te reactions but did you ever found out :http://jquery.bassistance.de/accordion/?p=1.1.1now click on it and it dissapears\n17. August 2007 |14:56\n@Jonathan: If you use the accordion plugin for navigation you get state-saving for free: see the navigation-option. Otherwise: Can?t promise anything, but I?ll keep it in mind (and on a todo list).\n@Claudia: Good catch. Its fixed in the latest revision.\n@thijs: Thanks to some help from John Resig animations are now greatly improved. I?m just finishing up the next release.\n@Cees: The tabs plugin solves that nicely by using an extra ?hide?-class instead of display:none. So far the accordion plugin didn?t depend on any stylesheets, but I think that is worth the trouble - I?ll try to fix that for the next release.\n@vinnie: That should be fixed by now, included in the next release.\n20. August 2007 |12:24\nThx 4 this great plugin!Eine Frage / Wunsch: Kann man das Teil auch so steuern, das die einzelenen Accordion-Inhalte unabhängig voneinander auf und zu geklappt werden können? Sprich: Man kann beliebige aufklappen ohne das die anderen zugehen.\n20. August 2007 |21:14\n@Jürgen: Nein, das wird auch nie möglich sein. Lässt sich aber auch mit jQuery-Hausmitteln derart einfach implementieren, das es niemand stören sollte. Dieses Plugin gibt sich große Mühe zu verhindern, mehr als einen Teil zu öffnen. Diese Beschränkung zu entfernen ist wesentlich aufwendiger als ein passendes Plugin zu schreiben.\n23. August 2007 |10:59\nIs it possible to add Keyboard control to an Accordion ?

Regards!\n27. August 2007 |18:00\nHi, a little help!?\nLove the plugin, great for quick and easy accordions. I?m having a problem using it to Show / Hide a form though. Here is my test page:\nThe form expands fine, but clicking ?Giftwrap? again doesn?t collapse the accordion. Also in IE7 there is an error message ?Out of memory at line 1947?\nAppreciate any advice on sorting this out, I have achived similar using mootools in the past but i?m using jquery for other elements of the site so don?t want to double up on scripts if I can help it.\n28. August 2007 |22:41\nIs there a way to specify the content that should be shown when hovering over a certain heading?Reason for asking: I have a list that is kind of heads up - in each li there is first the content followed by the heading:\ncontent for item 1\ncontent for item 2\ncontent for item 3\nSo when hovering over the title div of a list entry the content div should appear and the content div of all the other list entries should disappear. At the end it should look like the drawers used in the right hand menu on the downloads page of apple (http://www.apple.com/downloads/).\nAny tips on how to achieve this using the accordion?\n28. August 2007 |23:30\nHi there. Have you made any progress with the Accordion + Interface situation? I ask after spending hours trying to find the bug in my code that was breaking things, then discovering it was a known issue. As Interface is possibly the widest-used effects plugin I think many other programmers will come up against the same issues, which is a shame as your Accordion functionality seems to be much better and smoother then theirs. Also, does it create problems if a plugin/function has the same name as a previously-defined function?\njQuery 1.1.4 + Interface 1.2\nThanks for the incredible work!-Ciri\n29. August 2007 |09:05\nIt?s late and maybe I?m wrong but there seems to be an infinite recursion error (Firebug says ?too much recursion?) when multiple dd tags are used inside a dt tag. Maybe the plugin was never meant to be used with this html structure.\nExample:Top example has the problem. Error occurs on clicking a heading.The bottom doesn?t.\njQuery version is 1.1.4.\n29. August 2007 |21:33\nYou should think having just a single dd container in witch you can put any xHtml block elements. Style them with CSS and fly like the wind.\nwhatever onewhatever twowhatever (?)whatever last\nsomething onesomething twosomething (?)something last\n30. August 2007 |12:47\nMmm, ok, problem solved - animated:slow is not supported anymore.Jörn - is it possible to note somwhere (maybe in the release notes ?) when certain options/defaults are changed in new version and not downward compatible ?Makes it easier to implement new version.-C\n31. August 2007 |18:12\n@Cees: Sorry for the trouble. You?re right, I should have noted that.\n@joseluis: Could you post a test page?\n@Leandro: Thanks for the report. I?ll give that a try.\n@cormac: Please try to wrap the h3 and form elements into another element.\n@Claudia: So far the plugin uses nextUntil to determine the content elements. Due to some changes in the animation system that doesn?t work so well anymore, next() would achieve the same. Making next() configurable (replace with prev()) should be possible. I?ll give it a try.\n@Cirieno: Sorry, there isn?t any progress on that front. And most likely there won?t be in the future: Interface?s successor, the UI project, is scheduled for the third September.\n@Erin: Thanks for the report. That is a regression bug introduced by the change in the animation system. It can be avoided by using only a single content element between each header element. I?ll try to find a more solid solution.\n@Pablo: Right. That restricition makes the plugin much simpler and isn?t really a problem from a styling viewpoint.\n1. September 2007 |17:11\nGaneshji Marwaha, from the mailing list, said, ? i think that it is kinda disturbing if we hover on one item and immediately if we hover on another item, the accordion doesn?t open for the second item.? I agree with him and think that the interface should always be responsive to the user. If the mouse is over a menu item (header) it should activate. All animations in effect at the time should proceed immediately to their end state. The animation is really just an ?extra?. The ability to navigate a web site by accessing the menu items is of paramount importance.\nOne possible solution might be to offer either behavior as an option. Another might be to incorporate the hoverIntent plugin.\nThanks for all your work on this. I, and I?m sure the jQuery community, really find it valuable.\n1. September 2007 |19:08\nExcellent work - keep them coming!!\nI have found a problem tho? if I include interface (http://interface.eyecon.ro/) the drop-down breaks?? I?ve made a quick example for youhttp://www.electricsnow.co.uk/jorn/\nAny help would be ace! But I know you?re busy!\n1.

September 2007 |17:31\nThanks that worked, problem solved.\n4. September 2007 |19:18\n@Erin: Thanks for comment. There are a few technical implications on that matter, but I?ll keep that in mind and try to find a solution that allows you to configure the preferred behaviour.\n@Robin: Interface overwrites jQuery?s animate method, which breaks the accordion plugin. Klaus Hartl had a similar problem, and his solution was to rename the animate method in Interface at all occurences. The topic came up on the jQuery discussion listrecentlyas well.\n@Grayson: I?ve been tackling that problem, but haven?t found a correct solution yet. Basically I?m tacking the width of the parent element, substract the height of each header and use that as the height for each content element.\n6.

September 2007 |18:41\nJorn- Re. the comments about HTML comments causing trouble in IE, I?m also seeing this behavior in IE6 and 7.\nUsing the default DL methods, I had HTML comments between my DL and DT tags and the plugin didn?t work (although no error was thrown).\nI think IE?s DOM explorer considers comments nodes of a sort, so that may be the issue.\nEither way, removing HTML comments from the markup that is to be Accordioned resolves this issue.\n8. September 2007 |12:45\n@Sergio: That link isn?t working.\n@Rob: Thats weird. I?m currently not sure how jQuery handles comments, but that may be the source of the problem. Or the nextUntil method that I?m still using, though I plan to replace it with next.\n8. September 2007 |15:12\nWierd, theis working fine here. Can u give it another go please? Anyway I?m using anchors for the header ?toggler?, I?m doing this so I can accomplish an hover effect with css, this way the hover effect work with IE6 but on the other side the accordion is not working to good on IE7, only way it does work is if i close the opened content first before opening another. Like i said earlier i?m kind of a noob, so please forgive any stupid questions :S .\n10. September 2007 |00:26\nHello, is there anyway that this plugin could load multiple nested ?s and convert them into inner accordions?\nlike having a level one accordeons and then a second one (clicks) with a different colour style?\nThat would be very helpful into a weird project I am having.\n10. September 2007 |09:30\n@Sergio: That worked, thanks. According to some IE7 debugging, the script tries to set a height of -3px to some element, which IE doesn?t seem to like. I don?t know yet how/why that happens.\n@Panagiotis: You can apply the accordion manually to multiple levels. Give them a class to distinguish the different levels, and all should be fine.\n11. September 2007 |06:45\nIs it possible to have the contents called from external files for the subsequent accordions?\nThe first one have static content, meanwhile other accordions calls HTTP requests when clicking..And caching of the content itself?\n11. September 2007 |09:48\n@kung fu suit: No, that isn?t supported, and won?t be available anytime soon.\n11. September 2007 |11:47\nHi - any chance of running jQ 1.2 with Accordion 1.5 ?!?\n11.

September 2007 |21:44\nThank-you for the excellent plugin! One question, however. I am attempting to create a site that will gracefully resize by utilizing em-based measurements for height and width.

The irish thank you in advance for any advice you can give.\n12. September 2007 |12:08\nI?m in the process of implementing your accordion menu on a new site I?m developing but I?ve run into a couple of issues.\nFirstly, when initially visiting a page and clicking a header item, a number of child elements are not displayed in the accordion. In fact, in this case, it seems only 4 items from each menu are initially displayed. If you click around the header items a few times, eventually, the correct number of items will begin to be displayed.\nAlso, run time to time and especially in Safari (for Windows, which is still in beta to be fair), when you first go to a page, all child menus are open. This is intermittent and I can?t see any particular reason for it.\nI hope you can help as these are pretty much ?show stoppers??\nMany thanks in advance,Terry.\n12. September 2007 |20:08\nHello and thank you for the wonderful accordion plugin. My first experience with jQuery has been great so far? with one issue that I cannot sort out.\nEverything works great? perfect, really? except for IE7, where I get ?invalid argument? on line 723, col 30, when trying to click the first ?next? button. Other browsers are fine, no js errors thrown at all.\nI have messed with this for hours and finally have it narrowed down, though I do not understand it.\nAs you can see, each of the sets of form fields is inside a tag\nIf I delete the opening and closing tags from the first section, the whole thing works fine in IE7, and all the others. If I put the back in, it breaks in IE7, throwing that error.\nDo you have ANY idea why the fieldset container is affecting the function of the page in this way?\nI have no doubt it could be something in my markup, but I am not seeing the forest, or the trees, at this point! Thanks in advance for any possible help?.\n12. September 2007 |20:16\noops .. my html got stripped, shoulda thought of that, sorry\nwhat I was trying to say is ?fieldset tags?\nwhen i take out the first fieldset, the thing works finewhen i put it back in, ie7 chokes, as per the example page posted\n12. September 2007 |20:37\nHoly smokes? I just got a flash (ok more like a flicker) and decided to play with the element order.\nSimply putting a tag after the closing fieldset, before the button, seems to have fixed it in IE.\nThe same page should now work in IE7, but I will leave the broken one up in case anybody wants to take a look (just a demo, not my real page).\nSo now my question is WHY this would matter?\n12. September 2007 |20:43\nand actually? it seems to be the br tag before, not after, the fieldset that did the trick ( I put both as a test, only the one before the opening fieldset actually fixed it)\nsorry for so many posts on this, last one promise!\n12.

Its buried somewhere in the installation tool. There is also a free debugger, check thisreference for debugging tools in IEfor details.\nGlad to hear you figured it out even without those tools.\n@Jim: I have to check the support in jQuery 1.2 for relative values. But so far there isn?t anything but pixel heights.\n@IrishLadd: You?ve set a wrong class in the nested accordion. There is another ?header1? which should be ?header2?.\n@Terry: The first issue seems to be an incorrect calculation for the animation. I haven?t figured out yet whats is wrong there, but I?ll look into it.I?ll test in Safari, too.\n@Michael: Now that is another stupid IE bug. Thanks for reporting.You may want to check my validation plugin, for, well, validationThe latest revision supports validation of subforms. It isn?t documented yet, but there is ademo which you can check\n@agustin: Yes. I haven?t released an update yet, but until then the compability plugin should fix all issues. Though issues with animations may be a different story.\n@Jeff: The animations in the accordion plugin rely on some jQuery internals, any those changed a bit. I?ll look into it.

September 2007 |14:11\nWill future development of the accordion plugin be mirrored in JQuery UI, or is that now a separate branch?\n18. September 2007 |17:47\nNice work although I?ve find one bug if you can call it that. The following does not work.\nDoesn?t get the correct height of the scrolling div. Just thought I?d let you know.\n18. September 2007 |20:33\n@Suzanne: That should be possible. Could you post an example page?\n@Chango: There are other accordion implementations that do exactly that, though not this one.\n@Leandro: That used only for code-highlighting. The actual dependencies are listed on this page.\n@Mike: The idea was to continue development as part of UI. So far the accordion in UI and this one are identical. I haven?t decided yet on how to continue that, there are a few arguments for branching the development.\n@ZNS: Could you post that as a demo page? Thanks.\n19. September 2007 |17:48\nI?ve got the same problem as Leandro.\nIt basically uses height of the first element I hover over, instead of a height of the highest element.\nI tried his hack. It works but It throws up errors in the console:\nDom style propertyInvalid value for property height:Line: 1-XXXpx\n20. September 2007 |01:06\nLove the accordian, thank you!\nIs there any way for the accoridans to be different sizes / heights?\nI am using the code from example 2 - just happened to match my html exactly!\n20. September 2007 |12:14\nOk - tested new jQuery 1.2.1 with current Accordion 1.5 - all ok now !\n20. September 2007 |13:46\nI also get a weird jiggle on my accordian in IE 7\n21. September 2007 |13:01\nHi.I?m having problems with your plugin. If I have an accordion with let?s say three blocks that has the heights 300, 20, 100 and I open the one with height 20, then when I open the others they all have height 20 and the rest is hidden. I?m using the settings alwaysopen:false, active:false, animation:?easeslide?\n21. September 2007 |20:43\nHi, im having the same problem than Ulrik.\nwhen using the setting ?autoheight: true,?, all submenus get the height of the longest item in the menu, but i want it to show only the height that belongs to each item. I?ve tried using ?autoheight: false,? but I get the same results than Ulrik.\npd. Thanks for the plugin accordion.\n24. September 2007 |23:25\nUpdate: ?alwaysopen:false, active:false? only seems to work if you set animated:false as seen in the demo.\n25. September 2007 |01:43\nHi, I like this plugin,but when I use it,I find a proplem,when my content?height overflow the content-div?s,the content can?t be displayed fully in the div,so I want to add a scroll at the content-div,I write css:?overflow:auto;?.but it?s not useful!What can I do?Could heple me?\n25. September 2007 |09:10\nI want to use some of the features in jQuery 1.2, and could not get the accordion working with the compatibility plugin? so I decided to change my page over to the version of accordion shown in the UI examples.So far so good? but I am having a hard time with the ?activate? function.\nI want to emulate your ?wizard? functionality, using a form button with the class of ?open1? to open the second panel. My syntax (below) is not throwing errors, but it is also not working - what should I be doing differently?\nHere is a sample page using this code.http://comparemyagent.com/forms/test.cfm\nThe text links work fine, but the buttons do nothing.\nI am sure my syntax is all wrong? but I can?t find an example anywhere of using the activate() function with a click on a named element.\nThanks in advance for any help you can give? unfortunately I have to have this online very soon.\n25. September 2007 |09:13\nVielleicht könnte man ja keine Pixel zum Hochzählen der Höhe verwenden, sondern Prozentangaben, also von 0% bis 100% Hochrechnen und die Eigenschaft display:block und overflow:hidden vergeben. Müsste doch funktionieren oder?\n25. September 2007 |09:20\nI am trying to nest a menu inside another menu. However the menu does not work, as the menu fails to function after the first click on the nested item.\n25. September 2007 |09:24\ngeeeezzz?. I keep doing this, sorry\nas soon as I posted that, I saw the missing dot before the classargh? this is what I get for trying to teach myself new code syntax after midnight.\nthis works perfectly from what I can tell.Thanks again for a great script? and for allowing me to have another conversation with myself in your public space!\n25. September 2007 |19:40\n@Frantisek Malina, Max, Ulrik: I think I?ve got that working in the latest revision.\n@Jack: Can you post an example page?\n@Stephen: Can you (also) post an example page?\n27. September 2007 |08:07\nexample page as follows:http://cma.herbal-lemon.net/test2.html\nTry clicking the region names and the country names, the ?europe? part won?t function properly; and the ?america? part won?t function properly after that (It does when the page is first loaded).\nThanks for the help!\n28. September 2007 |10:04\nI dunno if the following layout is not supported by the plugin?\nIn the page, the last item will not be properly shown after the header was clicked.\n28. September 2007 |10:06\n.div. header ./div..ul..li. item ./li../ul.\n29. September 2007 |12:34\n@Stephen: You are applying the plugin to the same element two times, that won?t work. It isn?t enough to specify a different header.\n29. September 2007 |23:05\nThanks for a nice plugin. I have two issues.\n- When I mouseover (or click) the menu header the whole list collapses and then expands very jumpy. I want it the selected menu to expand smoothly like the demo.\n- I have a form inside a . How do I get the selected menu to be expanded after I do a form submit?\n- Some of the menu sections are long and some only contain one item. Is it possible for the menu to expand just the size of the selected menu group?\nI have the testcode setup here:http://fjklima.no/admin/accordion.lasso\n30. September 2007 |13:30\nDid anyone try to implement the jQuery Cookie-Plugin by Klaus Hartl (http://www.stilbuero.de/2006/09/17/cookie-plugin-for-jquery)? I?d love to use the Accordion with cookies, this would be really helpful and improve the usability..\n1. October 2007 |15:54\nHey I love the accordion plugin!\nIm right now in a project that Im using the tablesorter 2.0 plugin. (http://tablesorter.com/)\nAnd the question came up. Is there a way to use the accordion plugin on a table that is sorted by the tablesorter plugin?\n1. October 2007 |17:35\nI?m working with the menu, but i have a little isse:\nI want to set the first element as default, but if i use de sintax, active: 0, it doesn?t work.\nWho may help me!!.\n2. October 2007 |12:52\nIch habe gemerkt das es massive Probleme mit der jQuery Interface Ereweiterung gibt .. gibts hier schon Lösungen? Interface ist eine tolle Erweiterung auf die ich ungerne verzichten möchte.Genauso wenig möchte ich auf das hier gut funktionierende Accordion verzichten\n3. October 2007 |17:56\nIs it possible to fix the headings at the very top of the accordion and update the content below?\nCheck out this demo to see what I?m talking about.\nCompare that to the previous demo.\nBasically, if you have a lot of content, having the headings at the top is much more usable.\n3. October 2007 |18:00\nHi,The accordion plugin doesn?t work with the latest jQuery(1.2.1) in Internet Explorer 6.Anyone have this problem?\n4. October 2007 |06:13\nHi! Great plugin, but I?m having a similar issue as Mat is. I need the height of each section to only grow to the size of the content inside of it, instead of the size of the largest instance. Is there a way to do this?\n4. October 2007 |15:06\nThank you for fixing the height calculation.\nOne wouldn?t believe it was a missing semicolon.\nFirstly I thought it wasn?t fixed, because I just downloaded the zip package from your site again. Than I checked the last revision in the repository and found it.\n4. October 2007 |22:45\nHey, just wanted to let you know that the accordion animations are broken in latest jquery version. I?ve spent a few days trying to get everything to work, got frustrated, then tryed downgrading to 1.1 and everything worked perfectly.\nPlease, if you can make your accordion plugin compatible with the latest jquery release it?d really be helpful. Please email me if you need any testing, or if you do release a new version.\n6. October 2007 |01:42\nHello,I wonder if there is a way to tweak the ?navigation? so that if the link is contained in the URL, then it would be active. I am not so good at javascript but something like this logic:\nif ?url? is contained in one of the menu links:- then that menu is active.\nAn option for navigation would be in.ex. ?p?. I send a from outside the menu and like this: ??p=sales&m=new?. Now I want the menu link that contains ?p=sales? to be active. All URLs containing ?p=sales? should activate that link.\nI think this is very common. Click on the menu ??p=sales? and after that do some stuff and the ?sales? menu is active until I choose another page.\n8. October 2007 |10:13\nI have a problem where the menu bounces. When I choose another menu option the menu first collapses and then expands. Does anyone see what I am doing wrong? I would like it to move smoothly like the demo.\nHere is the menu:http://fjklima.no/admin/accordion.lasso\n9. October 2007 |09:21\nHello Jörn,Are you busy or is this discussion moved elsewhere?\n9. October 2007 |10:09\n@Asle: Could you give thelatest UI accordiontogether with jQuery 1.2.1 a try?\nAbout the navigation option: You could just pass the value to check the href against as the navigation option, instead of always checking location.href. That needs a small modification in the plugin, but should give you quite a lot of flexibility.\n@Julia: Not yet. Though I?ve implemented it on the treeview plugin. Porting the serialization to accordion should be easy, I just need to find the time for that.\n@Pär: Would you put the accordion inside a table cell? Or the other way round? In theorey both ways should work, though I wouldn?t expect the tablesorter to sort acccordions.\n@José: Can you post a test page?\n@Alex: Support für Interface gibt es nicht mehr. Andererseits sollte das Plugin mit dem neuen UI Projekt gut laufen.\n@Alex (the other one): Nope, that isn?t possible.\n@pointdev: Could you give the latest revision (see link above) a try?\n9. October 2007 |15:24\nI?m using the according with flash content. No clue, if this has anyinfluence to it but if I open the page with IE7 the accordion is foldout. After clicking on the accordion headers it?s starting to work.Any idea why is that?\nPlease have a look:http://fb-con.lu/t3/index.php?id=9\n9. October 2007 |21:16\nI?m having issues with ie6 as well?\nIt does some odd things with styling. Any ideas?\n9. October 2007 |22:38\nYou did a good job it is very useful but I have a little problem with remembering the latest state when it goes to another page, how can I keep it on latest state even a new page loads.\njQuery(?#navigation?).Accordion({active: true,header: ?#navigation a.current?,alwaysOpen: false,navigation: false});You can check the page at :http://www.sercotec.net/demo/mtdisplays3/snap_aluminium_15mm.php\nThis is current option, I tried many others but it did not work, I will be glad if you help,\n10. October 2007 |16:55\nThanks,new fresh files did help on the smoothness of the transitions. I am not able to without help fix the navigation so if any one has the skill it would be nice to have the menu expand if the URL ?contains? the same target. I.ex. if the menu link is ??p=sales? and the URL is ??p=sales&id=44&action=detail? then the menu link would still be open even if it is not exactly the same.\n11. October 2007 |23:13\n@Florian: I get a ?Object expected? error on that page. The ?computer()? call (in body onload) seems to be causing that. You should fix that first. Alatest UI accordiona try?\n@Asle: Take a look at line 229:\nvar current = this.find(\"a\").filter(function() { return this.href == location.href; });\nYou need to modify the filter-callback to match substrings, instead of only exact matches. You could use indexOf() or regular expressions.\n12. October 2007 |09:39\nI figured out the problem. I?m using also the page scroll from jqueryinterface elements. Together it don?t work. Maybe you have an ideato fix this trouble?!\n13. October 2007 |12:56\nI have created a 5 tier navigation using accordion, see below;\n14. October 2007 |12:32\n@Florian: With jQuery 1.2+, youdon?t need Interface for scrolling anymore\n@Graham: I can?t really see the accordion in action there. Am I missing something?\n14. October 2007 |15:35\nYeah sorry, I submitted the post before adding the rest of my post.\nThere are 5 tiers to the navigation only the first 3 are displayed and when you click on the 3rd the navigation resets.\nHome > News > Archive > 2007 > January\nWhen you click on ?Archive? the nav closes.\n15. October 2007 |10:56\n@Graham: your menu doesn?t expand at all! I use XP and IE7.\n15. October 2007 |13:09\nGreat script, and the best accordion script I have seen so far. I spent 2 days on the net trying out all the different ones, but none of them did what I wanted. This one does, which is a variation of the ?guiter stuff? example.\nHowever, how can I use the extra animations from the Easing Plugin? I cannot write javascript myself, so the short usage instructions are useless for me\nI tried changing the line ?animated: ?slide?? into other animations, like ?animated: ?easeInQuad?? but that doesn?t work. I guess I have to add some more instructions somwhere, but I cannot figure it out.\nI?d appreciate someone giving me exact instructions what to add or change. Thanks.\n15. October 2007 |14:36\nOnly the ?Home? part has anything under it at the moment. If you click that or ?News? under ?Home? it will expand.\n15. October 2007 |14:37\n@Graham: Okay, I see. I need to experiment a bit with nested accordions, I?ll get back to you.\n@Jurgen: Ok, lets look at how?d you add support for easeInQuad:\nAnd you can then use it like this:\nYou can also use different easings for up and down, and different speeds:\nLet me know if you create interesting new animations, I may add them to the plugin.\n15. October 2007 |15:52\nis it possible that you expand the items in the other direction (to top).An example of what i mean you can find athttp://www.siemens.com(this one uses flash)\n15. October 2007 |18:20\n@Graham: I see it works fine in FireFox. But in IE7 it does not expand at all. The only thing I see there is the top bar ?Home?. Clicking on it changes color, but it doesn?t expand. You may want to check it out in IE7 yourself.\n@Jorn: thanks for your answer, I?ll try it out!\n15. October 2007 |18:48\n@Jurgen: Yeah I use FF, it also works (Apart from the 3rd tier) in IE6.\n15. October 2007 |20:57\n@Jörn: I?m afraid I don?t know where to put the first block? What file? What position? Please forgive my ignorance\nI also noticed that the parameter that is called ?active? on the top of the page, is suddenly called ?activate? in the examples on the bottom of the page. It took me quite some time to figure out which one was right and and how to use it. ?Activate? doesn?t work in my file, but ?active? does. Also the examples shown are in another format than the one my file has. By trial and error I found that this works:jQuery(?#navigation?).Accordion({active: ?#menu1?,});\nThis stuff is rather confusing for webdesigners like me, who are not that capable in the coding department. So some general info on how to use both ways of scripting would be handy I guess.\n15. October 2007 |21:58\nHow does the ?speed? option work? Whatever number I use, the speed of the animation remains the same. I have this in my file:\njQuery(?#navigation?).Accordion({active: ?#menu6?,header: ?.head?,navigation: true,event: ?mouseover?,autoheight: true,animated: ?slide?,speed: ?5?});\n16. October 2007 |08:39\nHihm, posted a question yesterday but it is gone\nmy question was if its possible to alter the accordion that it expands from bottom to top. As an example:http://www.siemens.com(This on is made in flash indeed)\nWould be happy getting some response.Thank youHorst\n17. October 2007 |09:53\n@Horst: Nope, currently not. Though you are free to give it a try yourself.\n@Jurgen: Just put the first block somewhere in front of your document-ready code, after the accordion plugin has been loaded. It adds functionality to the library and must be present before calling the accordion.\nYou are mixing the active-option and the activate method - right, those names are confusing. Anyway, just pass the active-option to the accordion plugin and all is fine.\nThe speed option doesn?t exist anymore, my fault in not correctly updating the documentation. You can customize the speed by using custom animations like mentioned above. Just replace the value for duration (in milliseconds) with something you like.\nThe intention of that approach is to offer resuable animation sets instead of custom stuff everywhere. You can post your favorite sets by posting a snippet like the one I?ve posted above.\n17. October 2007 |10:10\nGreat bit of code; thanks!!Trying to hide the selected item on mouseout; any tips on how to do this?\n17. October 2007 |12:41\nHi Jörn,it?s quite easy to make your accordion act from bottom to top.Gave it a try and you just have to fix the accordionContainer with css positioning.\nin my case:#nav {position: absolute;bottom: 20px;left: 20px;\nso, with this you have fixed the bottom position and it expands upwards - should have thought about this before\nthank you - it?s just a great scriptHorst\n17. October 2007 |18:11\nis your accordion script going to be implemented into the official UI-extension of jquery? Guess, i?ve read something on their plug-in-site ? ? If so, when a release can be expected? It would be really cool, if your script would be running with the latest jquery release.\nAs for now, i?m using the version, that i found in your download. However, i?m still in trouble with the height issue, although some other users confirmed the fixing of the problem by using the files from the repository. Actually, when downloading those files and implementing them into my site (local only at the moment), it?s not working at all.Am I missing something?\nBest regards and thumbs up for your efforts anyway,\n18. October 2007 |16:32\n@ben: You could add the mouseout event to the accordion container element and use the activate method to close it. Something like this:\n@Horst: Thanks Horst, great to see its so easy. I?ll add that to the demos.\n@lx: Actually the accordion is already part of jQuery UI. Though the first release didn?t went that well, but as soon as 1.1 is out I?ll state that here more prominently. I?m not sure yet what to do with this page.\nAnyway, the latest revision should work now with jQuery 1.2. Its not 100% compatible with the 1.5 release anymore: You have to specify the header option if you don?t use an anchor (?a? element) as the header. Otherwise it should work fine.\nLet me know if it doesn?t.\n18. October 2007 |17:49\nMaybe it?s necessary to make this more understandable for the people. Your two accordion scripts can be easily mixed up, especially when you follow the link at the bottom of the UI/Accordion-page (?>http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion?> ?A few demos?), for this refers to your ?old? script from this site and it seems to use a slightly different structure, doesn?t it? At the moment I?m using a structure rather than the documented structure.\nIs this still possible or is the UI version restricted to the latter one? And by the way, is there any difference between those structures anyway, when using them within the accordion?\n18. October 2007 |17:52\nOops, I?ve put the tags in brackets, thus they disappeared. I meant, at the moment I?m using a DIV structure rather than the documented UL + LI structure.\n18. October 2007 |21:08\nI have checked out the latest version from svn and it still does not have variable height on the content elements. It always gets the height of the first element opened and applies that to all of the other content elements. Did this get broken again in the latest release? It seems some people got it to work at some point.\n18. October 2007 |21:34\nI figured it out. I was not including the easing and dimensions js files. Once I included those, my content elements were displayed at the right height.\n20. October 2007 |14:50\n@lx: Once jQuery UI 1.1 is out, I?ll deprecate this ?standalone? version. Until then, both are very similar. If you use the UI version, you have to specify the header option if you are using something else then an a-element as the header. Otherwise there is no notable difference. The latest revisions for both are now the same.\n@Colleen: Ok, greatI?ll make sure to update the documentation once jQuery UI 1.1 is out.\n22. October 2007 |10:57\nI?ve just tried version 1.5 of the accordion but the autoheight function just doesn?t work proper at my project so I?ll keep on using 1.4 because it works fine, except on one issue.\nWhen you use the menu in FireFox it works fine! But when you use the menu in Internet Explorer the whole menu collapse for just half a second and opens the right submenu then. That?s really annoying when you are navigating trough the menu.\nDoes anybody know how I kan solve this problem?\nThis is how I activate the menu:jQuery(?#navigation?).Accordion({active: false,header: ?.head?,alwaysOpen: false,showSpeed: ?0?,navigation: true});\n22. October 2007 |12:38\nSeems that Accordion is not working with jQuery 1.2.1????\n22. October 2007 |18:53\nHi - Having problems getting this and jQuery 1.2.1 working together. I am running this with jQuery UI for tabs?\n26. October 2007 |16:56\nthanx for your great work!\nis it possible with accordion plugin to have alternate colors for the header rows (zebra style)?\n27. October 2007 |19:53\nI?ve got the UIaccordion version running with the latest jquery release. However, I?m getting into troubles, when placing flash content inside and viewing with Firefox 2.x. When collapsing, the flash content appears on top of anything else. No such problem in IE, though. Any chance to avoid this behaviour?\n28. October 2007 |20:46\n@Ad, Arjan and Stuart: Please give the latest revision a try if your are using jQuery 1.2.1.\n@mimmo: You can do that just fine using jQuery. Seelearningjquery.comfor some stuff on alternating tables. The same stuff can be applied to any other element.\n@lx: Could you post an example page for that?\n30. October 2007 |01:57\nI use an accordion in a navigation menu. The content page is an iframe, so every link in the accordion is targeted to the iframe. Everytime I click a link the accordion closes, even if alwaysOpen or autoheight is set. Is there a way to prevent this?\nI?ve made a basic testcase page here:http://dev.chillosophy.nl/test.html\nIf I click any link in the menu, I don?t want it to close.\nAside from this; great work on accordion, I love it\n30. October 2007 |12:09\nI?ve put a sample page online now. Please check outhttp://www.plaintype.com/uiaccordion_test/\nI?ve set a height attribute for the div with the flash content. Otherwise, the accordion even doesn?t expand. I seems as if the script doesn?t detect the flash content height.\n30. October 2007 |12:27\nBy the way: when viewing the page on a Mac with Safari 2.x, the accordion behaves just strange. When first loading the page, it?s not working at all. After clicking a few times on the headers, it starts ?working?, but then again it hangs a few clicks later.\n30. October 2007 |17:00\nSame issue with IE7. Menus are expanded and no effect.No success with nightly build of jquery on 30/10/07.\n1. November 2007 |14:01\nThe accordion is great, and I?ve added the squeezebox plug in you recommended to allow more than one element at a time,\nhowever I?m having problems collapsing all the elements.\nThat line of code gives me an error ?t has no properties?, ?t = t.classname || t?\nI?m fairly new to jquery and javascript so I?m having trouble finding out what?s causing this.\n1. November 2007 |17:52\n@Chillosophy: You need to give the accordion an indication on which part of the accordion it has to open. You can do that either by adding a class ?selected? to the current element, or use the activate-method to do that via JavaScript. Or use the navigation-option, but that works only when the location matches the link, that won?t work with your current setup.\n@lx: The behaviour in Safari 2.x must be fixed in jQuery itself, John is working on that.For the flash content: I have no idea. Most likely jQuery isn?t able to handle the flash content correctly, I don?t know what I could do about that in the accordion plugin. Could you post the tojQuery?s dev list\n@Pet: I haven?t updated the squeezebox plugin for a long time. Looks like the activate-method is broken. Currently I can?t offer any support for that, it was never released anyway.\n2. November 2007 |06:46\nHas anyone figured out how to get Accordion 1.5 to work with Jquery 1.2.1?\nI simply added the latest Jquery 1.2.1 file to the demo provided above and you can see that the first example breaks.\nWhat is the simple fix to keep the autoheight working?\n2. November 2007 |19:23\n@Victor: Please give the latest revision a try.\n2. November 2007 |21:03\nI?ve added the flash issue to the developers list. Let?s see?\n3. November 2007 |21:38\nIt gives error if out of all when one don?t have sub , how can i manage that one?\nAlso whoever has more links the height of other become some. Can?t it auto adjust the height as per the total sub links height?\n5. November 2007 |03:09\n@Asif: Give the latest revision a try and set autoheight:false.\n5. November 2007 |10:30\n@Jörn: Here?s a sample page I wrote, I?ve downloaded the nightly build of 04 nov. 2007. but I still have the issue on IE7.\n.xerror, .error { display: none }\njQuery().ready(function(){// simple AccordionjQuery(?#nav?).Accordion({active: false,alwaysOpen: false,showSpeed: ?0?,navigation: true,});})\nHeader 1Content 1.1Content 1.2Content 1.3Content 1.4Header 2Content 2Header 3Content 3Header 4Content 4\nHope this helps, thanks.\n5. November 2007 |23:06\nHi Jörn.Danke für dieses schöne Plugin.Es funktioniert einwandfrei im Firefox.Im IE 7 habe ich jedoch im Moment ein Problem.\nIch bekomme immer einen Fehler in Line 907.Habe andere builds der jQuery probiert jedoch ohne Erfolg.Die Stelle im JS Code bleibt jedoch bei jedem Build die gleiche.\nEs handelt sich um folgenden Abschnitt in der jquery.js:\n// IE actually uses filters for opacityname = name.replace(/-([a-z])/ig,function(z,b){return b.toUpperCase();});if ( value != undefined ) elem[name] = value;return elem[name];\nVielleicht hilft das ja!?Leider kann ich die mitgelieferte jquery nicht nutzen da sie mit meinem Datepicker nicht funktioniertIch habe auch die letzte version aus dem SVN gezogen?\n5.

Panel schliessen.Ich vermute der Fehler tritt beim ?schliessen? eines Panels auf.\n7. November 2007 |16:21\nyour plugin is amazing and I appreciate the nice work! However, I am trying to add some customized behavior to the drop down sections with no luck. Here?s my scenario:\nheader1- sub1-1- sub1-2- sub1-3- sub1-15\n(so, you get the picture: variable length sub lists)\nI am trying to set the .height() of the drop-down area dynamically to be the full height of the items or the height of the first 10 items only - whichever is less. (In the case where I limit the size of the sub container, I am adding an overflow: scroll.)\nI am able to iterate through the those children elements when click is fired, however the height property of those items always returns 0 - I presume b/c they are still display: none when it is fired. Is there a way I can do this after the Accordion has activated a section BUT before it animates it down?\nThanks for any tip you can provide.-Matt\n8. November 2007 |01:31\n@didou: No, that doesn?t help. Please post a link to a running example of your setup.\n@Robert: Auch hier gilt: Ohne Testseite kann ich nicht wirklich weiterhelfen.\n@Matt: Instead of setting the height on click, you should set the height before initializing the accordion.\nAnd you need the latest revision together with autoheight:false.\njQuery is able to calculate height of hidden elements with some fancy tricks, but it may be a bit limited, eg. for what I know you can?t calculate the height of an element whose parent-parent is hidden.\n8. November 2007 |05:21\nHi, This is an awesome plugin, however I?m having an odd issue.\nhad the accordion plugin. The problem is that it stops working after on click. i?ve noticed that if I click another header item it sets the height of the open content to zero (i used FireBug to inspect the element).\nDo you have any tips/solutions to get this to work correctly?\n8. November 2007 |08:20\nHi, great work there!\nJust a strange bug here that I can?t wrap my brain around..\n$(?#elists?).Accordion({header: ?div.head?, active: false, speed:500, autoheight: false});\nand the problem is that the height of each opening boxes is only as high as the first one I opened. So if the first one only had 2 items and another one has 50, well only 2 are shown.\nMy guess is I have some conflicting css properties overvall but hey.. i?ll spare the current headache I have with this and see if you might know what I?m talking about!\n8. November 2007 |14:48\nI used this great plugin onhttp://www.kwaliteitinklantcontact.nlfor the menu. It works smoothly in IE7, Netscape, and FireFox. But in IE6 it?s not as smooth as in the other browsers. What can be the problem, and is there a solution?\n8. November 2007 |17:21\nI found a simple solution for myself for an accordion style list with jquery basic effects.\n13. November 2007 |18:02\nHi Joern,i try using accordion with latest jquery 1.2.1 release.basically it works but autoheighting and slide animations are lookingkind of broken. Which version of jquery are using? Do plan any updates?\nThanks, your accordion is great anywaystefan\n14. November 2007 |21:28\n@Darren: Could you provide a demo page which actually uses the accordion? Just something that replicates the issue.\n@Jurgen: Could you clarify ?smooth?? Are the animations not smooth enough? Or something else?\n@Stefan: Could you give the latest revision a try?\n14. November 2007 |22:25\nI am having a problem with ie7. It is giving me a Line: 723, Char: 30 when I try to mouseover the top item. Basically, it works fine when i first mouseover (DOWN), then i mouseover up and it works fine on the 2nd 3rd items (ie. the parcel 1 and 2), but when it hits the first item ?Regional Geology?, it gives me that js error, and it doesn?t open?I?m lost, not sure what the problem is, seems to only happen in ie7, and it seems to be tied to the height, ie. I changed in the jquery.accordion.js file ?toHide? to ?toShow? which helps with the actual height differences, but it also seems to cause the ie problem, because with this set to the default ?toHide?, I don?t get the error.Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n15. November 2007 |14:19\nHi Jörn,today i downloaded your latest accordion.zip then unzipped everythingto my apaches document root. the test page was working fine.But then i exchanged the jquery.js from the zip with the latest jquery version 1.2.1 fromhttp://jquery.comand i had the same strange animationeffects like before. Why are you using a customized jqeury version? Or is it just an older release and if so which one?\n16. November 2007 |21:09\nHuhu,kann es ein, dass die aktuelle Version fehlerhaft ist? Hohe DIVs werde abgeschnitten, wenn am Anfang ein flacherer kommt.Ich bitte um eine kurze ANtwortDanke Gerhard\n17. November 2007 |11:54\n@Jörn: Yes, the animation is not smooth on IE6. It shows a flickering, restless animation and the speed is faster, like the animation is done quickly several times after each other before finishing. My client hasn?t complained yet, but that is because he uses IE7 (I know). But sooner or later he will bring it up, and besides, I would like to have it running smooth in IE6 too. I?m not that happy having delivered a site to a client with a menu that is not working as it should be for all visitors? So I hope there is a solution, because I love the effect and script!\n18. November 2007 |01:46\nDas plugin ist sehr nuetzlich, gratulation!Eine Eigenschaft ist etwas verwirrend, die Funktion ?activate?. Es scheint als rufe sie das ?click? Event auf. Wenn ein Accordion als Navigations Menu benutzt wird und ein click irgendwo in der Seite das offene Menu aktivieren soll bewirkt das ein Schliessen des Accordions anstatt es offen zu lassen. D.h. es ist kein eigentliches Aktivieren, sondern mehr eine toggle Funktion. Waere schoen wenn das Aktivieren in jedem Fall funktioniert.\n18.

To get navigation to trigger the correct menu I would like both these to open the ?products menu?:- example.com/products/- example.com/products/?id=453\nI believe there is something in the ?Accordion: function()? part of the script but I am not good at regex. How would you get it to filter out the active URL to remove the questionmark (?) and everything after that?And also - what about the ending ?/? before the ?. What if it is missing?Hope I am clear as to my problem.Thanks,Asle\n19. November 2007 |07:37\nhave been doing some dynamic things with accordion and have foundsome areas that don?t work. After some rather extensive debugging itappears that the problem lies in jQuery.\nI?m doing some very dynamics things with the content that lives in theaccordion. The problems I?ve found seem to stem from accordiongetting out of sync with the changes that are made to the data afteraccordion is called and setup. I haven?t unraveled why the problemsare happening yet but it appears that jQuery is cacheing hide/showvalues.\nI have provided a sample page that demonstrates one of the problems Ihave found with accordion and my tecniques.\nExample of broken accordion:\nWorks 1st time and then broken until refresh of page.http://dataprism.net/dpui/test2.html\nClick on ?Open Inspector? to open the inspector pane and use theaccordion, it works great.\nClick on ?Close Inspector? to close the inspector pane.\nNow click on ?Open Inspector? and the accordion is broken. Pagerefresh fixes it.\nWhen I open the inspector I dynamically build the html that will beaccordioned and call accordion.\nWhen I close the inspector I empty the accordion data, as the nexttime the inspector is opened it may be inspecting a different object.The accordion seems to get out of sync with the new data.\nI changed the code to completely remove all traces of accordion whenclosing the inspector and then reloading accordion when I open theinspector. The same problem occurs, leading me to believe there issome sort of bug in the jQuery hide/show code.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n19. November 2007 |09:23\nJorn,Got it figured out.\nunaccordion() must be called before using accordion() again. Otherwise the original clickhandler is not unbound and two clicks come in to accordion and confuse it.\nI now call unaccordion() when finished with the dynamically loaded forms that I?m using accordion with. Works great.\nThat was pretty tough to track down.\nThanks for the great work!\n19. November 2007 |16:21\nThank you.This version works fine jquery 1.2.1.http://dev.jquery.com/view/trunk/plugins/accordion/\n19. November 2007 |17:25\nAwesome plugin, but I?ve found one problem:\nUsing jQuery 1.2.1 with the following HTML\nI get an Invalid Argument thrown by IE6 on line 906 of jquery.js ? Debugging, the ?name? parameter to the elem array is ?? which is why the exception is thrown, but I don?t know why name comes as empty string.\nDisabling animation fixes the problem until I can find more time to see why.\n19. November 2007 |20:12\nwhat could affect the plug-in performance? (I mean, the slideUp/slideDown animation).Your demo works pretty smooth here in FF/Linux, FF/Win, IE6/7.\nBut when I try it in a site I?m working on, it runs slow, and not smooth at all.Although both the HTML/CSS code I use are valid, and always try to follow best practices, the structure inside each accordion chunk is rather complex, It seems that certain combinations of HTML/CSS can make accordion run slow.\nI know I should provide a live example. I don?t have one currently.\nThe question is if you actually know HTML/CSS factors (like too many floats inside an accordion chunk, or maybe some CSS trickery, like clearing floats with overflow:hidden) that can slow down the performance of the accordion slideDown/Up effect.\nThat?s all, thanks and thanks for this plug-in.\n21. November 2007 |13:49\nThanks for this fine PlugIn. I gave the last version, but there seems to be a problem with the calculating of the list-heights. This problem apears in FF/Safari (not in IE6/7) when a list contains a listelement with space an the option is set to autoheight:false. In this case the list is filled with unnessecary space behind the last listelement.Maybe the calculation of the heights is wrong.\nFor more information have a short look at my testpage:http://www.fromustoyou.de/externdownloads/sandbox/accordiontest/\n21. November 2007 |13:52\ni meant: i gave the last version (svn) a try. ;o)\n22. November 2007 |00:08\nI?ve been changing the contents dynamically, much like Mark on 19 November 2007. My version is Accordion 1.5 and jQuery of 2007-09-18 rev 3387.\nI inserted new html into a with code like$(?#panel1?).html(?<a>??);\nHowever, this panel remains open (and for each panel changed). The activate(-1) method could not close it (even with alwaysOpen: false).\nI don?t know how Mark did ?unaccordion()?. Where is it defined?\nKeep up the good work!\n23. November 2007 |15:45\nI?ve solved the problem. There is a need of additionally code for the case that the option is set to autoheight:false.\nFor more details use the link two posts above.\n@Jörn: Maybe this little codesnippet will added permanently to the next plugin revision?\n26. November 2007 |18:19\nHi I?m getting the same problem as Robert Henniger, the if ( value != undefined ) elem[name] = value; code in teh attr section of jquery,\n// second simple Accordion with special markup$(?#navigation?).Accordion({active: true,header: ?.head?,navigation: true\n// bind to change event of select to control first and seconds accordion// similar to tab?s plugin triggerTab(), without an extra methodjQuery(?#switch select?).change(function() {jQuery(?#navigation?).activate( this.selectedIndex-1 );});jQuery(?#close?).click(function() {jQuery(?#navigation?).activate(-1);});jQuery(?#switch2?).change(function() {jQuery(?#navigation?).activate(this.value);});});\n27. November 2007 |09:43\n@Stefan: Even if the version number isn?t there (I?ve now started to avoiding that), you can still take a look at the revision. If its older then the one from 1.2.1, its an older version.\n@Gerhard: Das ist ein bekanntes Problem und in der letzten Revision behoben, ein neues Release kommt bald.\n@Jurgen: I couldn?t replaicate issues with the animations themselve yet, though there is some flickering, most likely some collapsed padding/margin issue. I?ll look into it.\n@Juerg: Bei einem alwaysOpen:true accordion lässt es sich garnicht schließen, damit würde activate auch nicht mehr als toggle arbeiten. Löst das dein Problem?\n@Asle: Building the correct regex is one thing, using it to match the location another. I?ll try to tackle the latter.\n@Mark: Good to know you got it figured out. Please note that the current unaccordion implementation is very basic, it just removes all event handlers on itself and its descendants. That?ll work as long as you don?t add other stuff there - it sounds like you are replacing everything anyway. I?ll try to improve the unaccordion implementation.\n@Maniquí: You can use Firebug to profile your page, that may help.\n@Tomasz: I?ll take a look at it. If I can reproduce the problem I?ll add your patch. Thanks!\n@peter: The latest revision provides an unaccordion method. So after you?ve modified the accordion content, reinitiliaze it with $(?).unaccordion().accordion(?);\n27. November 2007 |11:37\nIf you hit the red button it errors but in firefox its fine\n27.

Has anyone else had this problem? This happens in Firefox and Safari for me? Any idea how to solve it?

December 2007 |00:02\nI just realized that it is possible to have nested accordions. The problem I am running into is that the second accordion is built on the fly when the page loads. The page is reading in the items from XML but it is not collapsing like it should. The items are formatting correctly based on the CSS but there is no accordion functionality. I am new to jQuery so I am quessing I am doing something wrong with jQuery and that the plugin is not the problem. Is there an order that I need to do this so that the dynamic accordion will function correctly?\n4. December 2007 |18:03\nNevermind my above questions, I got it working now.\nNow, any idea why this won?t work in a Vista Gadget with the latest version of jQuery (1.2.1)? It will work with jQuery 1.1.2 or earlier.\nBy the way, thanks Jörn for such a great plugin.\n4. December 2007 |20:18\n@Brian: So far nested accordions are not officially supported. It sometimes works, but often the dynamic inner heights screw up the outer accordion. It would be great if you could provide an example of a working nested accordion.\nI can?t say anything about Vista Gadgets, sorry.\n@Virtual Numbers: Considering that it falls back to plain HTML and text when no JavaScript is available (eg. Google bot), without hiding anything, it should be pretty good for SEO. I don?t have any numbers though.\n@Nick: Using both the navigation option together with an activate-call right after the accordion initialization seems like a potential problem. You should remove one of those two. If that doesn?t fix anything, please post a testpage.\n@Thomas: There is no support for nested accordions yet. I?d be happy to change that if someone provides a good example.\n@Pete: You can check the header element for the selected-class or check the display value of content elements (display:block, active, display:none, not active).\n7. December 2007 |00:05\nFirst, great plug-in. Took me a little while to get it working, but once I got past that part it is great.\nOne thing I can?t seem to get working though is the height of the menus when expanded. Is there a way that each expanded <dl> can be the height of the enclosed content.\nHave tried autoheight: false and autoheight: true, maybe I?m just missing something that is obvious.\n7. December 2007 |10:41\nI?m having animation problems with an accordion with nested tables in IE7. Using ?slide? causes the accordion contents to flicker twice. If animation is turned off all is fine.\nHas anyone else come across this issue; is there a known workaround?\nI don?t have access to a webspace ATM, but do have a page that demonstrates the issue: I can mail it if required.\n7. December 2007 |15:48\ni tried to change the speed, but nothing works.\nhow can i change the speed of the accordion.\n11. December 2007 |15:39\nCould be this script modify in the way to set CSS style after finish NOT e.g.\n<ul class=\"sub\" style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 142px; display: block;\">\n<ul class=\"sub\" style=\"overflow: hidden; height: auto; display: block;\">\nBecause I want to do accordion in accordion and due to actuall work of script it is not possible.\n19. December 2007 |21:47\n@Cees - Making the print output display all content was important to me as well and found the following css rule did the trick for me (I?m using a definition list/DL for my accordion):\n@media print {dd { display:block!important; height:auto!important }\nI think the ?!important? is key to overriding the javascript-added display:none.\n20. December 2007 |18:16\n@Phil: There is an undocumented option ?fillSpace? in the latest revision. As long as your content elements don?t have any padding (put it on nested elements when needed) it should work fine. You can use either fillSpace or autoheight.\n@designerno1: You have to provide a custom ?animation?. Something like this:\n@Jirka: There is an option clearStyle in the latest revision, which removes the overflow and height styles. Though nested accordions are still unsupported.\n@Harry: Thanks for the snippet. I?ll add that to the plugin?s css file.\n26. December 2007 |23:05\nI also had a problem getting it to work with IE using jquery 1.2.1\n28. December 2007 |13:49\ni just upgraded to the latest version of the accordion and i?ve lost access to the .change event that it triggered. i had been using it to ajax in content and put it in the accordion div, which had been working fine in the old revision i had, from late august. now, i can?t even tell if my dimensioning issues are solved because my old code is not longer working. can you offer any insight as to how i can now access the newContent object?\n$(\".monthcontainer\").each(function() {if (typeof arguments.callee.count != \"number\") {arguments.callee.count = 1;else {++arguments.callee.count;var mycount = arguments.callee.count;$(this).addClass(\"called_\"+mycount);}).accordion({header:\"div.monthly\",active:false,alwaysOpen:false,fillSpace:true,clearStyle:true}).change(function(event, newHeader, oldHeader, newContent, oldContent) {var classes = this.className;var called = classes.split(\" \")[1];var i = called.split(?_?)[1];var catcher = newContent[0].id;var j = catcher.split(?_?)[1];var l = oldContent[0];var period = newHeader[0].id;if (i===j) {/*$(l).css({display:?block?,width:?100%?,height:?50px?}).block(?<div class=?waiting?>Fetching Days<img src=?../img/loading_blue.gif?/></div>?);*/$.get(?hedge_cost_ajax_totals.cfm?,{period:period},function(data){newContent[0].innerHTML = data;$(?##receptacle?).append(data);var h = $(?##receptacle?).height();$(?##?+catcher).height(h);});});\nthank you very much.\n28. December 2007 |20:45\nThank you for sharing this fantastic script.I am wondering if there is a way to expand more than one item at a time so that you can expand, say two items out of five from a list?Hope this isn?t too basic of a question, I am still pretty new at this. Thanks again.\n29. December 2007 |02:24\nnever mind about that???..sometimes hours and hours of coding lead to strange strange things at times\n4. January 2008 |01:14\nFirst of all, thanks for that great plugin!\nBut there is something that i don?t understand. Somehow, links are not working in the ?content? area if you use the div tag to seperate ?headers? and ?content??

January 2008 |02:52\nFirst off this is a great script thanks so much for taking the time to do all this. Anyways to the point, the menu keeps bouncing up and down one the mouseover and i can seem to get the auto height to work. Is there a way to anchor the height so that it does not do this. Thanks again!\n4. January 2008 |10:42\nHi there. I was suffering from an IE7 specific problem when using the clearStyle setting set to true, and event set to click. The list was an ordinary ul with li?s, and anchors for headers.\n$(\"#rightcol .nav\").accordion({event: \"click\",header: \"a.head\",active: \"#current\",selectedClass: \"active\",clearStyle: true,animated: \"slide\",alwaysOpen: false});\nWhat happened was that when you clicked an item in the menu it would expand it\'s children as expected, but if you were to click another header it would not expand it\'s children and close the collapse the other item, but immediately follow the href along with a javascript error in the console.\nTo fix this problem I edited the the jquery.accordion.js file, on line 134 (height: \"\"). I removed this line and replaced it with clear: \"both\" and it appeared to fix the problem.\nHopefully this will help anybody suffering from the same difficulties.\n8. January 2008 |21:49\nThere are some serious problems with this plugin in ie7.\n9. January 2008 |01:27\nI?ve got three unique-named imagemaps that I?m trying to integrate into your accordion plugin (great job BTW) with three selects, one per map?.\nWorks great in Firefox, but only works in the first accordion select in IE 7.

January 2008 |12:34\nHi, great plugin, but have a little issue with IE7+Vista?. when my webpage loads up, the user sees a very quick flash of the expanded content, before being hidden. Every other browser/os combination is fine. Anyone else have this problem? Is there a quick fix for it? Thanks\n10. January 2008 |19:17\nI would like to say thank you for the great plugin.\nUnfortunately I?m having an issue right now that I hope you might have the answer for. I believe this might be the same problem that Stephan was mentioning in his January 4th post.\nI?m using your plugin for a navigation column. the code looks something like this.\nThis is kinda like the code you have for one of your demo?s and everything works great when the EVENT option is set to ?mouseover?. But if you change the EVENT option to the default ?click?, which is what I would like to use for this navigation, the links no longer work. The accordion works just fine and it opens up to dispay the sub links, but you can?t click on those sub links and be directed to the appropriate page.\nSo I was wondering if you have ever came across such an issue or maybe have a quick resolution for the problem. I appreciate your time.\n10. January 2008 |19:31\nI apologize but this is the code snippet for the example in my previous post. I forgot to use code tags and < >.

In Firefox it takes the height of the closing and keep it until a refresh of the page, and in IE it crash (no more reaction from the accordion).\nHere?s my code :\n// first simple Accordion with special markupjQuery(\'#faq_accordeon\').Accordion({header: \'h2.title\',active: \'false\',alwaysOpen: false,autoheight: false,animated: \'easeslide\'});\nvar wizard = $(\"#wizard\").Accordion({header: \'.title\',event: false});\n$(\"h2.title\", wizard).each(function(index) {$(this).next().children(\":button\").filter(\".next, .previous\").click(function() {wizard.activate(index + ($(this).is(\".next\") ? 1 : -1))});});\n// bind to change event of select to control first and seconds accordion// similar to tab\'s plugin triggerTab(), without an extra methodjQuery(\'#switch select\').change(function() {jQuery(\'#list1, #list2, #faq_accordeon, #navigation\').activate( this.selectedIndex-1 );});jQuery(\'#close\').click(function() {jQuery(\'#list1, #list2, #faq_accordeon, #navigation\').activate(-1);});jQuery(\'#switch2\').change(function() {jQuery(\'#list1, #list2, #faq_accordeon, #navigation\').activate(this.value);});\nand in HTML :\n29. January 2008 |23:04\nI?m having two difficulties. I have a test page using slightly modified versions of your demo markup here:http://www.wiredprojects.com/dor/site_v1/accordion2/demo/index.html\nI?ve implemented Ad?s solution for hrefs that he posted on 13.Apr.2007 to make it work in the second example that uses the ?click? event. Not sure why links work when the event is set to mouseover as in the top example, but not click in the second one.\nIs Ad?s method the recommended one when using the click event?\nAlso, the panel height seems to keep varying depending on re-opening a panel. Initially, they all size to fit their content, but when re-opening a panel, additional white-space seems to be opened up.\nFYI, these examples are using your demo css only very slightly modified to change ?navigation? into a class for multiple use on my test page.\n30. January 2008 |01:10\nFurther to my earlier email, I should have mentioned that the panel-height white-space does not seem to be present in all browsers. Ones that work okay are:\nNestcape 7.2 MacSafari 3 Mac & PCIE 6\nThe ones in which I experience inconsistent panel height on reopening are:\nFirefox 2 Mac & PCOpera 9.22 Mac & PCIE 7Netscape 9 PC\nThough Safari seems the exception to this theory, testing seems to suggest that something is amiss in newer browser implementations.\n31. January 2008 |20:42\nIt definitely doesn?t work on IE6 and JQuery 1.2.2 (throws javascript error), when the animation is set to true. With animation: false, works fine. Hope will be fixed, it?s a great plugin !\n5. February 2008 |22:10\nHi, thanks for the Great plugin!I am having some difficulty using it with tertiary navigation.Seems that the tertiary nav closes all of the accordion navs when clicked?Also, is there any way to activate the header on click as well as having it reveal the sub nav, rather than just having it reveal the sub nav?\nHere is an example of what I?m trying to do:\nHere is my jQuery code:$(\'#main_nav\').Accordion({active: \'a.selected\',header: \'a.head\',navigation: true,alwaysOpen: false});<div id=\"nav\"><ul id=\"main_nav\"><li><a href=\"#\">Item</a></li><li><a href=\"#\">Design</a><ul id=\"sub_nav\"><li><a href=\"#\">Identity</a><ul id=\"tert_nav\"><li><a href=\"#\">Brushed</a></li><li><a href=\"#\">Providence</a></li><li><a href=\"#\">Photography</a></li><li><a href=\"#\">Net</a></li><li><a href=\"#\">Film</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"#\">Print</a></li><li><a href=\"#\">Interactive</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"#\">Letterpress</a></li></ul></div>\n6. February 2008 |20:03\nDoesn?t work all that well in FF2 with jquery1.2.2, have to useRev: 2821 (dated 2007-08-21) so animation is smooth and complete.\nIn IE6 using it with Rev:2821 it throws a stack overflow error, not in 1.2.2 though, just doesn?t work.\n6. February 2008 |20:17\nDisregard last post of mine.I just grabbed the code out of SVN and everything works like a charm in all browsers.\n7. February 2008 |17:12\nDoes anyone has a solution for a multi level accordion? I saw Xavier had a solution but after that he vanishedOr maybe a hint to work on.\n8. February 2008 |21:33\nhello, i try to use the plugin with a dl list. If you have one dd after dt (like in your demo), it is ok. But if you have more than one dd (for example :dtdddddddtddddetc...the plugin only consider the first dd. It is a bug, no ?\n12. February 2008 |13:45\nI have a problem where it seems that autoheight ain?t working correctly. When I first expand a submenu with let?s say 4 entrys and then expand a submenu with 7 entries only 4 get displayed. I?m using accordion 1.5. You can have a look at it on the left hand side of this page:http://www.bluefire-jeans.eu/collection\n14. February 2008 |22:59\nHabe Dein Akkordeon gerade ausprobiert und dabei folgenden Bug entdeckt:Im Firefox 2.0 (andere browser nich geteste sollte dort aber auch auftreten) wurde nur jeweils der erste link pro Akkordeonelement angezeigt. Also nicht die links die das akkordeon auf und zu machen, sondern weitere enthaltene links.Die haben keinen href, weil ich die über js dann noch bissle manipulier.\nauf jeden fall hat in zeile 250 oder so, hab ich dann bei den defaultsheader : \'a\'inheader: \'a.ui_accordion_list\'geändert.Evtl muss man auch den Klassennamen noch modifizieren.Scheint zumindest auf den ersten Blick zu funktionieren.Top Arbeit! kommt sehr geil das Akkordeon.\n15. February 2008 |23:12\nI need it to ignore a that I use to extend the that it displays/hides?\nHow can I do that? (it keeps adding height to that ?clear? div, making it cover my content!)\n15. February 2008 |23:13\nI meant ?ignore a <div> that I use to extend??\n17. February 2008 |13:04\nI?ve been trying to use this plugin as much as I can, and also giving it to all developer that work with me.\nMy question actually is pretty simple:\nI am using a 3 level depth navigation. Collapse, expand, everything works fine except the fact that the second level doesn?t allow me clicking even though the head is also a link.\nEven having children on the first level, it allows me to double click and go to the ahref. The first click expands the nav and the second opens the ahref.\nFor some reason it doesn?t work for the second level. Even double clicking it just collapses and expands the 3rd level. I expect to have the head open as it is ahref as well.\nCan anybody help me?\n18. February 2008 |00:17\nAre there some very simple instructions on how to use this plugin? Everything I?ve been reading here makes me wonder if I could ever get it to work, sounds complicated. Thanks.\n19. February 2008 |12:58\nI?m having problems with the accordion in IE6/7 on PC. When rolling over the ?merchandise? links on the right-hand side of this page -http://www.jazzpublishing.co.uk/new_merch_nav/- the whole column seems to be flickering as if the sub-elements of the accordion are visible for a fraction of a second. Any ideas what could be causing this?\n27. February 2008 |18:27\nFantastic bit of code dude? but i have a question about using this for a navigation. it says in the page above that you can do the following:navigation (Boolean): If set, looks for the anchor that matches location.href and activates it. Great for href-based pseudo-state-saving. Default: falseis there an example of this being used as i dont really get how to make it set the ?active? link!?\n4. March 2008 |21:50\nHey, great code, I wrote some of my own fucntions in to autohide the when animating to stop artifacting from happening. So it does almost everything, but how would I set it to have everything closed, so, when it?s loading there?s no awkward point when everything is exploded open.\nOpenin IE for an example of this awkward explosion.\n4. March 2008 |21:58\nhey guys. i am trying to use a include file for the navigation\nits a 3 tired nav based onhttp://www.bluescap.com/nst/test2.phpfrom Torgil\ni can keep my selection active.i have looked at the active and activate thing, but i dont understand it.i tried puttingjQuery(\'.level1\').Accordion.activate(\'3\');jQuery(\'.level2\').Accordion.activate(\'1\');jQuery(\'.level3\').Accordion.activate(\'1\');\nin the page that is calling the include but that dosnt work.but the nav gets reloaded every page link.. and dosnt keep its active state..\n4. March 2008 |22:07\nHi, first of all I wanted to thank you because your menu is great and very easy to adapt to different needs.\nI?m having some trouble making the ?speed? attribute to work?could you please put a more advenced example of a menu that uses it?\nI change its values but I do not see any difference in the menu?s behaviour. I?m working with IE7 and Firefox.\nThank you very much and best regards, Andrés.\n5. March 2008 |15:46\nhello, i try to develope an effect for the ui accordion (this one) witch first close the opend element and then open the clicked element. is there anybody who can give me a sign how this works with the plugin? best regards Jens\n6. March 2008 |20:28\nHi Jörn - and thanks for a wonderful implementation of the Accordion menu. Splendid workI have one question though, as I?ve looked at the other accordion-plugin - is it possible to leave menus open unless clicked?\n8. March 2008 |11:32\n@Elaine: This accordion focuses on not allowing more then one panel open at a time. What you are looking for isquite easy to do with plain jQuery\n@Stephan: Thats fixed in the latest revision.\n@Martin: I can?t reproduce the issue you describe, could you check it again with the latest revision, or post a testpage?\n@Paul: This sounds like it is related to the issue where anchors within content elements didn?t work, that is now fixed.\n@Tom: The flash of content may be caused by something else delaying execution of the accordion script. Can?t say much about that without a testpage.\n@Derik, Dustin, Mike: Fixed in latest revision. Links now work just fine within content elements.\n@Santiago: You could try the differentwmode options\n@Domenico: Give the clearStyle:true option a try. If that doesn?t help, please provide a standalone testpage. I can?t find your accordion-init code on that page.\n@Phil: Using the latest revision, specify event: false or null/undefined.\n@Andrew, Watsei: No, header links are not supported and won?t be. If you need that, add your own logic, eg. bind a click event.\n@Djoh: You can hide the whole menu via CSS and show it once loaded via jQuery.\n@Chuck: That option was added after the 1.5 release. Give the latest revision a try - or the current release at your time of reading this.\n@David: Could you provide a testpage instead of pasting copied demo code?\n@stoyan: While the documentation says that the animated option accepts a boolean, it only accepts a boolean false. Or a string specifying an animation type.\n@Andrej: Didn?t quite get the issue, seems to work ok.\n@Charlie: Multi-level accordions work in the latest revision with autoheight:false and clearStyle:true.\n@christophe: An early version of the plugin supported that, but it wasn?t worth the trouble. You have to stick with a single dd and nest your content inside it.\n@Alexander: Please give the latest revision a try. There are quite a few related issues fixed.\n@Levi: Give clearStyle:true a try. Or disable animations (animated:false) if it doesn?t help.\n@Jose: Please give the latest revision a try and set autoheight:false and clearStyle:true to get the nested accordions to work.\n@Debbie: You may want to start with somejQuery basicsfirst.\n@Robin: Please give the latest revision/version a try.\n@Brent: Take a look at the demo page, the second example (?Navigation?).\n@Nick: Hiding stuff using CSS should help - its applied before the JS.\n@Paul: Looks like you need atree, not an accordion.\n@Andrés: The speed option was replaced by the animated-option. Specifying custom speeds is a bit more complicated, but much easier to use once setup. Take a look at the implementations of bounceslide and easeslide for a reference:\n@Designern01: See the previous answer. You need to provide a custom animation ?specification?. In this case, a custom easing which provides the close-first-then-open behaviour. You may want to take a look atjQuery?s animation APIfirst.\n@Per: As noted before,that isn?t what this plugin is about\n8.

Senator Obama, in my view, is head and shoulders above the rest.\nHe has the depth, the reflectiveness, and the resilience to be our next President. He speaks to the America I\'ve envisioned in my music for the past 35 years, a generous nation with a citizenry willing to tackle nuanced and complex problems, a country that\'s interested in its collective destiny and in the potential of its gathered spirit. A place where \"...nobody crowds you, and nobody goes it alone.\"\nAt the moment, critics have tried to diminish Senator Obama through the exaggeration of certain of his comments and relationships. While these matters are worthy of some discussion, they have been ripped out of the context and fabric of the man\'s life and vision, so well described in his excellent book, Dreams From My Father, often in order to distract us from discussing the real issues: war and peace, the fight for economic and racial justice, reaffirming our Constitution, and the protection and enhancement of our environment.\nAfter the terrible damage done over the past eight years, a great American reclamation project needs to be undertaken. I believe that Senator Obama is the best candidate to lead that project and to lead us into the 21st Century with a renewed sense of moral purpose and of ourselves as Americans.\nOver here on E Street, we\'re proud to support Obama for President.\n INDIANAPOLIS: DANNY!E Street Band keyboardist Danny Federici treated Indianapolis fans to a special appearance at Conseco Fieldhouse on March 20th.

Despite the hurricane force he and the E Street Band frequently mustered during their two-hour show, plenty of fans cheering them on no doubt recall the nights of yore when this fabled group was just starting to break a sweat at the two-hour mark.Still, what this outfit does on stage each night remains fairly daring, and the older they get, the greater the risk of the without-a-net abandon with which they administer the sacrament of rock \'n\' roll.Read the rest of the review here\nOAKLAND BREAKOUTSBruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\'s show tonight in Oakland featured three tour premieres: Two Hearts, Racing In The Street and Working On The Highway.

The sheer vitality of Mr. Springsteen, 58, belting an entire set of showstoppers straight from the gut and working the stage with his longtime band, provides all the hope the lyrics struggle to find.

Kern\nThere are plenty of people who follow Springsteen tours, seeing multiple shows across the country. Part of the motivation to do so, aside from seeing friends and sampling local cuisine, is the search for that transcendent experience. You know the one -- where all of the cosmic tumblers fall into place, and you don\'t have a thought about anything else except living right there in the moment, huge smile on your face, no place else you\'d rather be for those two-plus hours.\nPlenty of people feel that way about the one show they see in their hometown. But for the tour followers, those moments don\'t happen every night. They didn\'t happen in Dallas last night, but that\'s not a complaint. As with every Springsteen show, there are moments when the world seems right.\nMax Weinberg has described how he has to watch every move Bruce makes on stage to be ready for anything that gets thrown at him. For many in the crowd, that\'s what a concert is like, too -- all eyes on Bruce, all the time. His performance is so riveting that, as good as they are, the E Street Band seem to be simply providing a vehicle for Bruce to dominate. But if you stop and watch the individual band members, you realize why the E Street Band is so mighty.\nIn some cases, it\'s just the warmth they show for each other. Last night was Max\'s birthday and Bruce gave him his own curtain call at the start of the encores -- even though Max then left the stage, as his drums aren\'t a part of \"Meeting Across the River.\" But it can be something even more subtle: the look on Steve\'s face when Clarence nails a solo; Bruce\'s awe at Nils\' prowess during \"Because the Night\"; Charlie Giordano applauding quietly in the darkness when Bruce mentions Danny during the intro to \"Magic.\"\nThe band\'s ability as musicians sometimes gets overlooked. I\'m not talking about those out-front solos, when you\'re finally made to look at someone other than Bruce. Subtle things, like Garry\'s bass on \"Last to Die,\" the little flourishes Roy has been adding on the intro to \"Jungleland,\" Max getting a chance to show off the delicacy on the kit that he displays on Conan, Soozie\'s fiddle providing color throughout.\nSome of those moments are sometimes bizarre. Is there a front man for any band that would stop in the middle of the show when he notices an entire grammar school class in the front of the pit and carry on a private conversation with them in front of 18,000 people?\nIt\'s these things -- not the setlists (although \"My Love\" to open the set would make me very happy), or the crowd, or the special (and not so special) guests -- that keep me on the road night after night, show after show.\nTuesday, April 8, 2008\nProve It All Night\nI arrived in Anaheim for my third Bruce show in five days (I know, lucky me!) planning to write a blog post focusing on \"the gathering of the tribe,\" the way that hardcore Bruce fans come together for a show and bring with them rituals such as sign-waving and chanting along with certain songs. But the performance put on by Bruce and the E. Street Band on Tuesday night put an end to those plans. The performance was simply breathtaking, astonishing, transcendent, even perhaps historic. Yes, it was that good.\nYou never know when you see a show in Anaheim whether Bruce is feeling like he\'s playing Los Angeles (the entertainment capital of the world) or just another show in the suburbs. Tonight, from the opening strains of \"Thunder Road,\" there was no doubt. Was opening with \"Thunder Road\" a nod to his 1975 performance of the song to open his set at the Roxy in 1975, the version that led off the Live 1975-85 box set? Listening to that historic show (as well as the mind-blowing performance he gave at the Roxy three years later on the Darkness tour), you couldn\'t miss Bruce\'s sense of mission, his desire to prove to the assembled industry players that he was worthy of all the praise he had received.\nYet after \"Thunder Road,\" the set began in a pretty standard way. So maybe Bruce wasn\'t feeling the need to prove anything?\nWrong. The next five songs were a tour de force of Bruce and the band at their best: \"Atlantic City,\" \"Candy\'s Room,\" \"Reason to Believe,\" Prove It All Night\" and then \"Because the Night.\" Showing his command of the moment, Bruce audibled by adding \"Prove It\" to the set (see, he was out to prove something), then audibled again in the middle of the song, whispering to Nils to keep his acoustic guitar and not switch to his electric for his usual incendiary guitar solo. That was because Bruce had determined mid-song (apparently) to also play \"Because the Night,\" and it would be during that song that Nils would do his solo.\nThe next surprise came on \"Brilliant Disguise,\" when Bruce paired with Sister Soozie on the duet, the first time in memory that the female vocal wasn\'t handled by Patti Scialfa. Considering the relationship issues driving that song, it was a curious decision. But perhaps the message wasn\'t about male-female relationships this time. Maybe it was the Bruce-audience relationship he was alluding to, as in, \"you think you know me but maybe you don\'t. Maybe it\'s all a brilliant disguise.\" (Or maybe he just felt like playing it.)\nOr maybe it was a request from Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, who was waiting backstage to once again join Bruce and the band for a words-can\'t-describe electric version of \"The Ghost of Tom Joad.\" This is such a great electric song, something like \"Seeds\"-meets-\"Youngstown\"-meets-\"Murder Incorporated.\" Bruce and Tom spit out the lyrics, highlighting the injustices detailed in the song in a way that the acoustic version doesn\'t convey. And Tom\'s guitar virtuosity cannot be understated. The man is in a league of his own, as he demonstrated during his two solos.\nThe surprises continued when Bruce skipped both \"Devil\'s Arcade\" (which wasn\'t even setlisted) and \"The Rising\" (which was). That let him go straight into \"Last to Die,\" which kept the show\'s tempo and volume high. I adore \"Devil\'s Arcade,\" but I have to admit it is starting to sound a little stale and static, which may be why it got a rest. It\'s such a well-crafted song that perhaps it defies reinterpretation, but Bruce may want to add a guitar solo or some other element to bring it more to life in the concert setting. Another shocker to close, as \"Out in the Street\" again followed \"Badlands,\" the well-established main set closer until Anaheim. (It was great fun, though I\'m not convinced it\'s a main set closer.) During the encores, Bruce then kept the surprises coming, pulling out \"Meeting Across the River\" before \"Jungleland.\" Any Bruce concert with that pairing is one for the ages.\nAnd that, perhaps, was the point of the evening. Let there be no doubt: Bruce Springsteen is an artist for the ages.\nMonday, April 7, 2008\n\"Good evening. We\'re out for blood,\" said Bruce Springsteen a few songs into Monday\'s concert at the Honda Center. After an opening salvo that included the tour premiere of \"LIght of Day\" to open and \"Murder Incorporated,\" this was already evident, but if anyone missed the point, the songs that followed -- \"Trapped,\" \"Reason to Believe,\" and \"Because the Night\" -- would hammer it home. This was the E Street Band at their hard rocking finest.\nBruce may have started the show singing, \"Things can\'t get any worse, they gotta get better.\" But by the time we reached the tour premiere of \"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\" his clear message was that the sentiment was wrong -- that for many people, things are continuing to get worse. Nobody\'s kidding nobody about where this highway is going. Rage Against the Machine\'s Tom Morello, whose band has covered the song in the past, made a stunning guest appearance for this one, and it was a blistering performance: a reinvention of 1995\'s acoustic song as rocking guitar assault, and the heart of the thematic presentation that Bruce put together on this night.\nIt had long been suggested that \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" was originally written with the band in mind, and the performance here certainly lends credence to the alleged origins. This updated version took the timeless elements of the song and framed them for presentation in 2008\'s United States, where nearly 1.3 million properties were subjects of foreclosure activity last year, and 80,000 jobs were lost last month alone. Like the Joad family, people\'s hopes and dreams are being blown away, and this version of the song responded with anger and defiance. It demanded that its message be heard.\nI\'ve always enjoyed seeing Bruce watch someone he really respects, and it was evident that he holds a lot of respect for Morello. Bruce and Tom traded the first two verses and shared the third, with Morello adding extra emphasis to \"Look in their eyes Ma, you\'ll see me,\" spitting out the line with barely controlled fury. Then the guitar solos began, the hardest rocking moment of the tour to date. Morello\'s work here was simply astounding -- scratching, coaxing, and forcing out an epic coda to all the themes brought forth in the song.\nNone of this is to say the show was dour; even in the face of hard times, there are things to celebrate. An impromptu \"Out in the Street\" closed the main set, with the band scrambling to switch instruments for the audibled song after \"Badlands.\"\nThe encores saw a few more guests join the band on stage. After having watched the entire show from the pit, guitarist Bobby Bandiera (of the Asbury Jukes, lately touring with Bon Jovi) joined in for a rollicking \"Ramrod,\" and Sessions Band members Marty Rifkin and Marc Anthony Thompson made an appearance on the show-closing \"American Land.\"\nPrior to the encore opening \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes,\" Bruce repeatedly called out for a response from all the \"California girls\" in the crowd, finally entreating, \"Come on thrill me, I\'m getting old!\" Having witnessed a third outstanding show in four nights, I would have to disagree.\nSAN JOSE, CALIFORNIASaturday, April 5, 2008\nBefore Saturday night, I had only seen Bruce perform in the traditional East Coast strongholds or in the Midwestern Rust Belt -- cities where there is a clear, organic connection between the songs and where they\'re being played. In San Jose, there is no Springsteen tradition: he hasn\'t played here regularly, no legendary shows took place here, and there isn\'t much of California in his lyrics (at least not Northern California). Moreover, San Jose seems antithetical to the Springsteen ethos, as a city of explosive growth that produces consequent feelings of rootlessness, a slick, shiny avatar of the new globalized technology economy. And Silicon Valley was out in force Saturday night at HP Pavilion, as videogame moguls filled the VIP seats and Apple CEO Steve Jobs showed up in the pit. Even so, as the houselights dimmed and a spotlit calliope rose from the back of the stage, plinking out a haunting circus tune, the arena became familiar Springsteen space, by turns carnival, tent revival, dance hall, protest rally, beach party, church service.\nNo need for suspense: it was an excellent show. The set was well-chosen, the band sounded sharp, and Bruce was in excellent voice, especially as the show progressed. Interestingly, some of the strongest performances were songs from the new record. \"Gypsy Biker\" has received rave reviews from previous bloggers, and with good reason: the guitar work was scorching. Soozie\'s delicate harmony on \"Magic\" was bone-chilling, making that song one of the most powerful of the first half of the set. \"Devil\'s Arcade\" was stunning, both musically and visually: beginning with a beautifully hymnic organ line from Charlie Giordano and ending with a heartbeat tattoo on the drums as Max and his kit were illuminated in a vision of pure silver light. Several classics received inspired performances as well: Bruce\'s harmonica solo on \"Prove It All Night\" was pure sexy rock \'n\' roll, and the guitar duet between Nils and Steven on \"Promised Land\" was masterful -- a display of two awesome talents. The only disappointment of the evening was an almost lackluster \"Bobby Jean,\" which couldn\'t quite sustain the crowd enthusiasm following the ever-popular \"Glory Days.\"\nAs in other recent shows, Bruce took requests seriously. A local radio station poll resulted in a performance of \"Fire,\" showcasing the easy rapport (both personally and vocally) between Bruce and Clarence (who now appropriately sits on a gilded throne when he isn\'t playing). Bruce audibled \"Something in the Night\" and \"Detroit Medley\" in response to signs (the latter song from a sign that read \"Ain\'t Too Proud to Beg for Detroit Medley\"). The pit swooned when Bruce picked up and then coyly revealed an \"Incident, Por Favor\" placard (although it was on the setlist anyway, I still want to offer a hearty \"gracias\" for it). Then there was the bald guy in the front who had Sharpied \"Glory Days\" on his shiny forehead. Bruce pulled him on stage and the band rewarded him with a rollicking version of his request. Even if the ink doesn\'t wash off for a week, I bet it was worth it. And while I suggested that there is no longstanding Bruce tradition in San Jose, that may not be entirely true: there was the sign that read \"Bruce, you\'re my real dad!\" Bruce\'s bemused response: \"I was in these parts around 1969....\"\nFor me, the highlight of the show was \"Incident.\" Many people have tried to explain Bruce\'s appeal by talking about identification, suggesting that his songs represent their personal experiences and that he is singing the stories of their lives. While I have no doubt this is true for many fans, this doesn\'t capture my relationship to his music. On Saturday night, when I put my arms around my boyfriend and swayed as Bruce told the story of Spanish Johnny and Puerto Rican Jane, I wasn\'t reliving an experience from my youth. Rather, I was living someone else\'s youth, finding a way into experiences that I never had. And that\'s pretty remarkable.\nSeveral hours earlier, as we waited in line outside the arena to be admitted to the pit, two street preachers harangued the line. Using a bullhorn, they preached brimstone and damnation for all of us who do not sufficiently fear god (and singled out \"queers\" as particularly worthy of eternal torment). It was tempting, during the show, to hear \"Reason to Believe\" as a rebuttal to this kind of fundamentalism. That song was powerful as always, but now performed in a Texas rock arrangement coupled with occasional snatches of aggressive distortion-mic vocals, the song is a strange mix: atheism at a roadhouse.\nBut I think the better response to people like those preachers would be an affirmation of the experience I had at the concert that night during songs like \"The Promised Land,\" \"Badlands,\" or \"The Rising.\" These are songs about faith -- not necessarily faith in God, but faith as a human experience that may (but also may not) allow one to live in the face of loss and horror. Borrowing a term from a philosopher, I consider these songs to be examples of \"prayer demythified,\" prayers that don\'t fit into religious doctrine and that do not necessarily even have an addressee. This is the recognition that the act of prayer has a human meaning, even in the possible absence or inaccessibility of God. During these songs, when Bruce, lit from below, raised his hand above his head, many of us in the crowd matched the gesture. For me, this is a true experience of prayer -- joining with my community to offer a sincere prayer for faith, for hope, and for love.\nSACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIAFriday, April 4, 2008\nDriving up the interstate to Sacramento from the San Francisco Bay Area, it was hard not to think about the last time we made this trip -- almost exactly five years ago, on April 9, 2003. The day Baghdad fell.\nBruce had just returned from two weeks of shows in Australia, and the war had started in his absence from American soil. That historic day was his first chance to comment, and he did so with a passionate opening trio of songs: \"Born in the U.S.A.\" (acoustic, just Bruce on the 12-string, angrily pounding out the tune), followed by \"Who\'ll Stop the Rain\" and \"No Surrender.\"\nIt was a classic artistic reaction to current events, and it left little doubt where Bruce stood on the decision to go to war and its consequences.\nThe first leg of the Magic tour also left little doubt about Bruce\'s point of view. I felt that the setlist and his furious performances reflected an intense anger about the current state of affairs and his sense of powerlessness. Gone, for instance, was the prayerful \"Land of Hope and Dreams,\" replaced as the show closer by the ironic \"American Land\" with its false hopes and foolish dreams.\nBruce\'s apparent loss of hope was a big shock, and it left me conflicted about those shows. I\'d always turned to Bruce for his unyielding message of hope amid despair, but on the first leg, he seemed to have precious little hope to offer. And if Bruce Springsteen had lost hope, I wondered, what hope was there for the rest of us?\nSo as much as I would have never missed an opportunity to see Bruce perform near my hometown, I approached Arco Arena with some trepidation. I wasn\'t sure if I was prepared to live in a world in which I couldn\'t count on Bruce Springsteen to lift me up.\nIt was clear that things had changed with Max\'s opening snare shot, the beginning of the playful teenage love song, \"Spirit in the Night.\" Right from the start, Bruce was much more of his old, loose self -- mugging for the audience, shaking hands, smiling and laughing and generally having a blast.\nDuring his intro to \"Livin\' in the Future,\" Bruce briefly signaled the likely reason for his better mood, making reference to \"eight years coming to an end\" -- clearly meaning the two terms of the Bush Administration. Bruce Springsteen, I thought, had found something new to hope for: better days in a post-Bush America and world.\nBruce also clued us in that this show would be about partying as much as anything when he explained Patti\'s absence. She was home guarding the house, he said, where \"beer kegs were rolling up the driveway, pot brownies were in the oven and a Girls Gone Wild bus was pulling up\" as he was headed to the plane that would take him to California. Ah, youthful innocence! That was just the elixir for a rocker who\'d seen too much. So it was no surprise when Bruce pulled out another classic party song, the frat rocker \"Sherry Darlin\'\" (during which, in a performance decades before, he had told the guys in the audience that it was okay to throw up in their girlfriends\' purses if they needed to). During the encores. he also happily took the suggestion from a sign-holder to \"let Rosie come out tonight\" and subbed the cathartic \"Ramrod\" for the setlisted \"Glory Days\".\nI left Arco Arena feeling much better about Bruce\'s state of mind regarding our country and the world. Bruce had found something new to hope for: a fresh start for our country and the world. Party on!\nVANCOUVER, BCMonday, March 31, 2008\nMy 76-year-old Mom & I had driven to Portland and Seattle, and now for our third and final stop of the tour, it was our hometown show in Vancouver. Due to unexpected traffic on the way to GM Place we made it with little more than five minutes to spare to get a wristband for the lottery... but we made it and got lucky, too, landing a spot in the pit. My husband and my 79-year-old Dad were in seats about eight rows up from where we were standing.\nIt was a great all-around show in Vancouver with a few shake-ups. \"None But the Brave\"! Good choice. The new Magic songs were some of the highlights for us, too, and I love the ZZ Top-ified version of \"Reason to Believe.\"\nMy Mom had a blast as usual at the concert, and I could see several people noticing her singing and dancing along to all the songs -- including Bruce! He apparently remembered his dancing partner from Vancouver 2003, and during \"Dancing in the Dark\" he was looking for a way to get her onstage. Unfortunately, in preparation for the show ending, security had moved/locked the side barriers so there was no good way up. So, no reprise for Mom. Oh well...\nAll in all a great trifecta of Northwest shows -- though we were sad that Patti wasn\'t there, we missed her stage presence for sure. I have to say, we loved the upbeat \"American Land\" ending to the show. Since Bruce skipped the entire Northwest on the Seeger Sessions tour, we missed out on that music live in concert... it sounds like a lot of fun!\nThe Shame of British Columbia(Hey, Bruce said it, not me!)\nThere\'s nothing worse for a Bruce fan than leaving a show without a ticket to another show in your pocket. That\'s the situation I was in after the phenomenal show-for-the-ages that was Saturday night in Seattle (did you hear we got \"Trapped?\"). I got to work Monday morning and had an email waiting from Linda, a woman I met in a GA line during the Rising tour:\n\"I wish I were going tonight.\"\nThose six little words were the genesis of yet another Bruce adventure. Next came a mad quest for tickets followed by a last-minute dash home for my passport and a run for the border. I guess some Mondays you go home and watch Dancing with the Stars, and some Mondays you go to Canada!\nOkay, now I know three concerts in four days seems excessive to the uninitiated. Yes, my coworkers think I\'m a nutter, and my friends roll their eyes. I know I\'m a bit of a freak. I know this. (By the way, if you\'re reading this, chances are you\'re a little bit of a freak, too.) That\'s why I like going to the shows: I\'m among \"my people.\" They get it! And there\'s always a whole bunch of people who are way bigger fanatics than I am, so I seem normal by comparison! It\'s fun to sit around chatting about our \"first time,\" our favorite songs and so much more....\n\"I heard they soundchecked \'Downbound Train\' in Seattle -- think they\'ll play it?\"\"What\'s your screen name on BTX?\"\"You were in the pit in Dallas too! What number?\"\"Have you heard the Atlantic City boot? Oh. My. God.\"\nSo I went to Vancouver with the expectation of another crowd of Springsteen groupies that was ready to rock. Our seats were incredible, in the first section in front of the stage. From there I could see those Bay Area girls I\'d met in the pit in Seattle -- they hit the lottery again and were waving to me from front and center. So lucky! The lights dimmed and the band took the stage at 8:15, launching right into \"Atlantic City.\" Another tour premiere! Linda and I were singing our hearts out.\nBut we were the only people in our section standing. Whaah??\n\"IS ANYBODY ALIVE OUT THERE?\"\nUm, no, not really. Not in Vancouver. Well, maybe sort of. Occasionally.\nSurely the place will erupt with \"Radio Nowhere?\" Not so much. \"No Surrender\"! Still, we\'re the only ones on our feet. Instead of communing with other fans, we were blocking their view. We were dancing, and the couple seated next to us looked at us like we were crazy. And we weren\'t even the crazy dancers -- you know, like the guys down on the floor rockin\' the air guitar like they\'re on stage. (Every show has those guys. I love them.) And oh, yeah - someone nearby had some pretty pungent weed and they were hitting it hard all night. It was pretty funny -- every time we caught a whiff, that couple next to us looked around scowling. Marijuana! At a concert! (In Vancouver!) Shocking!\nOne of those Bay Area girls had commented to me that when a crowd isn\'t into it, Bruce just works harder. He was pulling out all the stops trying to get some life out of this group. Back and forth he went, yelling for people to \"Stand up!\" There were pockets of fans around the arena who got into the spirit. The pit was on fire. But there was still a lot left to be desired. Asking for some help with the chorus on \"Sunny Day\" he said, \"Pathetic! The shame of British Columbia!\" He was joking, but the man had a point. During \"Long Walk Home,\" after enjoining the crowd to sing along on \"Hey pretty darling, don\'t wait up for me\" and getting a most lackluster response, he went back to his center mic, laughing and shaking his head like, \"Well, I tried.\"\nBut the show was great. Two tour premieres and \"Trapped\" again. Love that! When we heard the tell-tale organ notes, we lost our minds, squealing like high school girls. \"The River\" was a treat. \"The Rising\" is one of my favorite songs and, after three nights, I was finally able to put my finger on what was missing. Duh. Patti! Her vocals add an ethereal quality to that song that was missed, and I look forward to her return. Finally, at the end of the main set, the crowd roared to life for \"Badlands.\" \"Rosalita\" didn\'t get half the reception it did in Seattle, but Bruce had a blast with it anyway, and we danced our asses off. The whole band looked like they were having a grand time. It\'s always a party on E Street.\nAny night with Bruce and the E Street Band is a night well spent, even if it means two stops at customs and twice as long on the road as at the show. While trying to stay awake at my desk the next morning, all I could think was: That was so worth it!\nLast, happy birthday to Aunt Susie in West Caldwell, NJ! She gets it, too.\nSEATTLE, WASaturday, March 29, 2008\nThere\'s something so delightfully classic about a Saturday night rock \'n\' roll show, especially one right in the heart of the city. There\'s a heightened excitement and anticipation since people aren\'t running from work or school. They\'ve had time to get dressed up, hang out with their friends, and have a drink or two. And, Saturday night means that parents can get out with their kids. Saturday night in Seattle, I was sitting between two rows of the next generation of Springsteen fans: two teenage girls with their moms in front of us (the moms having seen their first show in 1976 at the Paramount) and a group of 20-somethings behind me for whom this was their third show. (Best overheard conversation: \"Yeah, I want a t-shirt, but get me something cool. Have Mom pick it out.\")\nThe band, too, seemed to be sharing in the communal good spirits. \"Trapped\" as a set opener (probably due to the plethora of signs present in Portland the night before) immediately engaged and excited the crowd. When people are standing at the top of the 200 level and pumping their fists, you know the night\'s going to be a good one. Tonight, the rarities flowed within the set instead of standing a little bit outside of it. \"Because the Night\" got a tremendous response even before Nils brought his usual brand of outstanding sonic wizardry to a solo that was still being applauded minutes after the song ended.\nA dedication for \"Ed\" in Seattle probably only means one thing, and we thank Mr. Vedder for coaxing Bruce into playing \"Your Own Worst Enemy\" -- and also bet that \"Point Blank\" came out of the closet for that same die-hard fan who first saw Bruce live on the River tour. People may make pilgrimages to see Bruce in Jersey, but in the Northwest, you could have heard a pin drop during \"Point Blank\": every word, every nuance was there for you to hear, and not shouted over by some moron screaming for \"Rosalita\" all night. The stellar performance gave me goosebumps and flashes of my own first River tour show (Hartford 1980, if you\'re keeping score).\nWhen I spotted the \"Rosie\" sign in the pit earlier in the evening, I had labeled it as \"optimistic.\" In a million years, I did not expect Bruce to reach into the crowd, pull out the sign, turn around and show it to the band, and then, finally, with an enormous, I-know-something-you-don\'t-know grin, turn around and show it to us. When Bruce wants to sing it, \"Rosalita\" is quintessential Springsteen, and bringing her out tonight was every possible shade of appropriate for this show and this crowd. Everyone was dancing everywhere: behind the stage, behind the soundboard, up in the rafters, in the guestlist seats, people singing words that they were sure they had forgotten, friends hugging and total strangers high-fiving. Bruce onstage, hamming it up, mamboing across the front of the stage with a grin as big as the venue.\nBy the time the show ended, it didn\'t matter if it was your first show or your 30th, everyone knew they had seen something special.\nTop of Their Game\nEven stiff Seattle spring rain couldn\'t dampen the crowd outside Key Arena on Saturday night. My wife and I ducked into the arena around 7:45 for what was my seventh Springsteen show (fourth with the E-Streeters), and the concourses vibrated with energy. You know how it is: anyone you make eye contact with becomes your new best friend because, hey, you\'re at the Springsteen show... and everyone who\'s there knows what that means.\nWell, at least that\'s how it felt before the show started. I have to admit that up in section 202, in and around row 3, we were searching for a pulse at times. Not because Bruce wasn\'t amped (more on that soon), but because -- I guess? -- the crowd is getting older or more conservative or something. (Overheard behind me in row 4: \"Hey, Steve, you want me to come BMW shopping with you tomorrow?\" Tramps like us, indeed.)\nAnd to be quite honest, I was worried that, after hearing rumblings of less-than-compelling shows in Cincinnati and Portland, if the Seattle faithful couldn\'t bring the heat, the energy, the noise, Springsteen would return the favor and we could be in for a disappointing night.\nBruce immediately put those worries to rest. I don\'t think the Seattle crowd ever completely kicked it into gear, but Bruce could not have cared less (nor I, for that matter -- my wife and I were some of very few in our section up and dancing for the majority of the show). It was by far the most satisfying Bruce show I have ever seen. From the opener of the trigger-wound \"Trapped,\" with the bombastic chorus after those seething verses, Bruce put us on notice that this was going to be a special night. He\'s so good, he can open with a non-album track -- unbelievable! \"Gypsy Biker\" -- probably my fave from the new record -- was fantastic live, as was \"Magic.\" Very powerful. Then \"Reason to Believe\" was a revelation, showing the wonderful evolution from the Nebraska \"demo\" to the Tom Waits-inspired D&D tour performance, now into a full-fledged band version, completely rockin\' and dynamic, bringing together the best elements of all the songs\' previous incarnations.\nThe highlights just kept coming: \"Because the Night,\" \"She\'s the One,\" \"Livin\' in the Future,\" \"The Promised Land\"... on all of these Bruce was cutting loose, having fun, strutting, sweating, a 58-year-old rocking out harder than any of us 36-year-olds could (and utterly putting all the BMW-shopping 58-year-olds to shame). All night he seemed loose, passionate, in the flow -- he was having a blast! Then he killed me with a mesmerizing \"Point Blank,\" the band expertly extracting its evocative essence, and Bruce singing (dare I say it) beautifully.\nThe encore missed a couple things I had hoped for (\"Girls in Summer Clothes,\" perhaps a Born in the U.S.A. classic), but the double-shot of \"Rosalita\" -- with Bruce dancing, goofing, posing, and the band in perfect union -- with a \"Born to Run\" chaser was, for me, Springsteen nirvana. I hope and pray to see Bruce & the E Street Band again someday, but if for some reason it never happens, I can rest in peace, knowing I have witnessed the master at the top of his game. And that is an awe-inspiring thing to still be able to say, think, and write in 2008.\nEuphoria! That\'s what I feel tonight. \"Trapped\"! We got \"Trapped\"! I still do a little dance every time I think of it. First song of the night! The band was rusty on this one, and Bruce joked that it\'s supposed to start off with a sweet organ intro that they didn\'t get quite right, but a little uncertainty is \"good for the band.\" No one was complaining. I didn\'t get a chance to flash my sign for \"Trapped\" because it got confiscated right after we got into the pit -- I guess signs, though in abundance, are not technically allowed? Nevertheless, I hit the pit lottery, so life was good. Stood in the rain freezing for a couple hours, but it was totally worth it. We joked that this was a crowd that would truly appreciate \"Waitin\' on a Sunny Day.\" How sweet it was when we got that too! (Though while singing this one, Bruce plucked a \"Sunny Day\" sign from someone in the pit. No signs? Sheesh.)\nSuffice it to say, from my vantage point, it was all good. So good. I was three deep from the stage, front and center. I was behind a 14-year-old who I noticed knew every word to every song, and a group of fun girls from the Bay Area who were up for the PNW trifecta of Portland/Seattle/Vancouver. Next to me was a woman who was 39-and-a-half weeks pregnant. It looked like Bruce might have a new fan at any moment. Security was nervous. During the show, Bruce and Stevie both gave her and her belly a nod and a smile.\nThe house was packed -- I couldn\'t see any empty seats anywhere -- and my home crowd came ready to rock. As seems to be the norm lately, this show was marked by audibles all night. \"No Surrender\" was the first, and after they started, we saw Nils smile and shake his head at Bruce and say \"You\'re crazy.\" With favorites like \"Darkness\" and \"She\'s the One,\" it\'s hard to pick a highlight, but \"Because the Night\" was a huge crowd pleaser. \"Your Own Worst Enemy\" made a rare appearance in the setlist, and the band is still working out the kinks. Bruce was laughing in the beginning and counted off the song twice to get it going. This was followed by another tour debut, \"Point Blank.\" Slow and deliberate, it paved the way nicely for \"Devil\'s Arcade.\"\nThe encore kicked off with another sign request from the pit, as Bruce asked for the sign and held it up to the band and then the crowd: \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out.\" Sweet! Yet another sign prompted the next song, and when he revealed it to read \"Rosalita,\" the crowd went nuts. Bruce had a lot fun with this one, and the whole arena was right there with him.\nAnd of course, I was right there from the beginning: \"Trapped\" from a primo spot in the pit... it doesn\'t get any better than this. What a weekend!\nBefore the show started, we spied Eddie Vedder in the wings, and the pit was abuzz with the possibilities. I have always wanted to hear Eddie sing with Bruce. They\'ve done it before, but I\'ve never gotten my hands on a recording. As singer-songwriters, I think they have so much in common, it would have been such a treat. However, the show wasn\'t wanting for anything (we got \"Trapped,\" after all, did I mention that?), so no complaints from me!\nPORTLAND, ORFriday, March 28, 2008\nFor All the Northwestern Girls!\nI have to fess up. I\'ve been known to make disparaging comments about West Coast crowds (come on, the L.A. crowd in October deserved it!). But Portland made me proud. So this is my official apology to the fine folks in the Rose Garden Arena: I\'ll see a show with you guys anytime! Bruce and the gang hit the stage around 8:35, a little later than I would\'ve guessed, and the crowd had already been roaring for Bruce for 20 minutes. From the darkness came Bruce\'s rallying cry, \"Is there anybody alive out there?!\" Over and over he yelled, whipping the crowd into a frenzy before the lights even came up. Then, lights on, and the band exploded into \"Night.\" First song and already Bruce and Little Stevie are sharing a mic, Nils and Clarence have their moments, and you know it\'s going to be one to remember.\nNils lit up the stage with several killer solos during the top half of the show. By the time we got to \"Prove It All Night,\" I was thinking, \"Damn, it\'s the Nils Lofgren show tonight.\" I heard an interview with Nils on a local radio show the day before the concert. He explained that Bruce is commuting to shows, sometimes arriving just one-and-a-half or two hours before the show. They sometimes have no soundchecks; he hasn\'t been sticking to a setlist; audibles every night. Nils said Bruce will let \'em know about five or six songs he\'s been thinking of -- some they haven\'t played in ten years. \"Sometimes he\'ll shout something out in the dark and start counting it off...\" Nils called it \"an exciting, seat-of-your-pants adventure.\" Indeed. For all of us!\nWord has obviously spread that Bruce has been taking requests via signs in the audience, and last night\'s crowd had plenty. I was surprised by how many audibles came right from the signs. \"For You,\" \"Lost in the Flood\" (sweet), and then \"Jungleland\" from a spiffy sign right in the pit. I counted four signs for \"Trapped.\" Alas, no luck on that rarity. (Full disclosure: I had one for \"Trapped\" and I gave one to a friend in the pit, but there were others, too!)\nOne thought I kept coming back to: this is not the same show I saw in L.A. in October. Maybe I can\'t blame it all on the L.A. crowd (though the guy next to me did check Monday Night Football scores during the show. Who does that?!). New album, early in the tour, fans aren\'t up to speed yet. Man, oh, man, how these songs have come together, and the Portland crowd was ready. \"Magic\" is now a song that Soozie makes shine. And I never expected \"Long Walk Home\" to be so damn much fun. Over and over Bruce called for us to sing along, \"Hey pretty darling, don\'t wait up for me, gonna be a long walk home.\" Mostly though, I feel like these new songs had a poignancy they lacked at the earlier show. This time around, \"Gypsy Biker,\" \"Devil\'s Arcade,\" \"Living in the Future\"... they seemed to resonate more with the crowd, and it was a better show for it.\nThe encore kicked off with \"Girls in their Summer Clothes,\" Bruce sending it out to \"all the Northwestern girls.\" This elicited squeals from the ladies that made the guy next to me cover his ears. Jealous, no doubt. This was followed by \"Jungleland,\" after which my buddy (a veteran of 30-plus shows) said, \"That might be the best \'Jungleland\' I\'ve ever heard.\" Bruce left nothing on the table with that one. I\'ll risk cries of blasphemy and admit I\'ve never been a huge fan of that one, but this performance won me over. I get it now.\nNext stop, Key Arena, home of the Seattle Sonics (um, for now anyway). I\'ll be heading down to the Key with my \"Trapped\" sign and my GA ticket to try for a spot in the pit. Wish me luck!\nCOLUMBUS, OHIOMonday, March 24, 2008\nFly me to the moon\nby Ed Hall Jr.\nWell, Columbus was a bit crowded Monday night, what with the return of Ohio State students from spring break and a Buckeyes men\'s tournament basketball game happening one arena over. But the only event that mattered, really, was the one that bumped the basketball team from their home court: Bruce and the E Streeters.\nThis was my third time seeing Bruce at this arena, and with my girlfriend\'s 18 year old singer-songwriting son in tow for his first show, we took our spot on the rail. Talk of Cinci peppered our conversation with fans around us. I must say that Bruce and his band deserve to have a mortal night, we all understand. He just sets the bar so damn high. So we (who pay attention) take notice and wonder if, coming back after Easter, full of ham and mashed potatoes (and maybe getting wind of some Cinci feedback), Bruce would remain earthbound, or come out and shoot for the moon.\nFact is, it was in between, leaning heavily towards the luminous orb, to be sure.\nBruce rolled out on stage just before 8:30 and then laid out a show full of curveballs and priceless audibles. As a \"Darkness\" freak, the only thing that would have made the four selections from that disc that made it into tonight\'s show any better would have been a slot for \"Racing in the Street.\" But I accidentally left our sign in the car, so that one was on me. \"Something in the Night\" was some powerful stuff. It felt church-like as Bruce laid out the tune steadily, with his Tele chiming away and the anticipated wails punctuating the song. He didn\'t hit \'em all, so I helped a little.\nThe house was packed, and there were dozens of children in tow. I love this. I can only imagine the thrill it is to bring your own child to one of these shows. Many had signs, some were right up against the stage, and it seems to add to Bruce\'s enthusiasm as he plays to them during the show as he did last night. When he comes down stage to let someone else \"play\" his guitar, he gives room for the smaller hands to take the \"lead.\"\nOne standout: \"Because the Night\" burned up the joint and was truly a pleaser, including Nils\' stunning turn. I love that man.\nBut signs, signs, they were, yes, everywhere. And eventually, Bruce walked over to stage left, pointing to someone in the crowd and making the shape of a square with his hands. Taking the small sign center stage, he showed the request to the band, all around, and then, after we politely requested he show us the sign, did we all get a little freaky at getting \"Incident\" laid upon us tonight.\nI was trying to both watch the show and keep my young guest up to speed. He knew most songs and was going home to write a piece for his high school newsletter. He didn\'t know what it meant for \"Rosie\" to come out (for what I think is only the second time this tour). Or how certain songs make you feel, like when you were 16 and listening to \"Adam Raised a Cain\" over and over on your cheap stereo. He was the observer/participant amongst a roomful of peaceful, energetic, mostly middle-aged, longtime fans.\nYes, Bruce and the boys (and girl) are allowed to play two-hour sets and leave folks scratching their heads. He can also come out and burn it up, like he did two days later a degree or two north and east. As I told my friend, that\'s why we go and go and go. Even in Columbus, a handful of tired notes, off guitars and a tough start on one harmonica solo aren\'t enough to turn away even for a second. This is Bruce, man. You just don\'t turn away from Bruce. Unless, of course, you\'re on your way to get tickets for the next show.\nBruce and the band left the Buckeye State on top, and thankfully, I and a new convert were there to see it.\nIncidentally, No Magic in Columbus\nBefore the Cincinnati show, I told some friends that just once, I\'d like to be \"between the mics,\" that small portion of the front of the pit between Bruce and Steve. The lottery odds of that are rather small, of course, but last night my number came in. So, any veneer of objectivity I might otherwise pretend in a review will be absent in this one, there\'s just no way. My ears are still ringing, I\'m operating on three hours sleep, I have a meeting with a new boss in half an hour, and, and... I\'m feeling just fine.\nEven taking into account a once-in-a-lifetime (so far) position, I\'ve seen Bruce enough times (73) to know that last night\'s show was pretty hot. Right from the opening salvo of \"The Ties That Bind,\" Bruce and the band were on a mission. Shaking things up just four songs in to the set, Bruce circled the stage multiple times to call out for \"Adam Raised a Cain\"; Charlie Giordano, unable to read Bruce\'s lips, missed the beginning of the song while getting the translation. Did it matter? Hell, no. I\'ll remember it for one of the more fiery performances I\'ve seen, including Bruce tearing into his guitar solo at the end.\n\"Magic\" was dropped from the setlist last night. That meant losing part of the spoken \"message,\" though I believe it was covered well enough during \"Livin\' in the Future.\" With the relatively quiet number removed, the show had virtually no letups -- rockers and classics all. It also opened up the set a bit for a different selection from the Magic album, and last night\'s debut performance of \"You\'ll Be Comin\' Down\" was more than worthy.\nHighlights? Way too many to remember them all. \"Something in the Night.\" Nils possibly topping the \"Prove It all Night\" solo from Cincinnati with a blow-out on \"Because the Night.\" Bruce\'s guitar playing on \"Adam Raised a Cain\" and on \"Incident on 57th Street.\" Every time Clarence played the bari sax. \"Long Walk Home,\" with Steve\'s new vocals at the end. A cameo by Ed Manion on bari sax during \"Born to Run,\" leading Bruce to say, \"C\'mon, Big Men!,\" and also producing the biggest, baddest sound I have ever heard for that song. And \"Rosalita.\" Yes, \"Rosalita\"!\nOne bit of strangeness, likely to become a recurring event at Springsteen shows, was the song contest winner. There are advertised contests for several upcoming shows for fans to select a song. Last night the \"winner\" -- and who knows how many voted; no one near me was aware of a contest for last night\'s show -- was \"Sherry Darling.\" Bruce asked who picked \"this bastard,\" prompting Stevie to raise his hand (Stevie used another little gesture involving both hands a little later when Bruce announced \"sexy time\").\nEveryone on stage appeared to be in high spirits, having a great time being with each other and giving Ohio everything they had. My favorite interaction was after \"Sherry Darling,\" when Bruce found a sign in the pit that read, \"Incident, Please,\" then, after holding it up, walking over to the piano to say to Roy, \"Incident, Please!\" Pure magic.\nCINCINNATI, OHSaturday, March 22\nLeave \'Em Wanting More\nAt just about 10:30 p.m. on Saturday, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band left the stage, having just completed \"American Land\" before a nearly packed house at U.S. Bank Arena in Cincinnati. The crowd was loud and had been on its feet -- even back in section 201-- for nearly the entire show. But, even before Springsteen was off the stage, the house lights were on. At barely two hours, the show was over.\nOn the floor, some long-time fans were apoplectic. What the #%&!? Anyone with an internet connection knew that, in the prior two shows, fans had been treated to incredible guest appearances. Not that anyone expected anything like that again, but here we were, on a Saturday night, with a phenomenal crowd, and it was already over?\nSure, we\'d collected a bunch of moments. An unusual (and unrushed) opener of \"Darlington County.\" Consecutive audibles by Bruce, the first shouted out to Max and Garry during \"Reason to Believe\" to follow with \"Candy\'s Room,\" and then for \"Prove It All Night.\" An incendiary, wailing, gun-slinging, foot-stomping (literally) solo by Nils Lofgren to punctuate \"Prove It All Night.\" An audience scan for signs, leading to a relatively rare performance of \"Be True.\" Following that, a show-stopping \"Lost in the Flood\" before the final five songs of the main set. And, as likely captured on YouTube already, an encore dance with Hannah during \"Dancing in the Dark.\" Still, I couldn\'t escape the feeling that Bruce rushed the band through the final hour of the show as if he were late for the plane.\nNot that the performance suffered too much from the breakneck pace. Clarence sounded great. Charlie Giordano fit right in, adding his own textures from Danny\'s spot. Patti wasn\'t there (Bruce\'s explanation, as it were, included a terribly lame joke about dealing with the kids and the hash brownies back home), so Soozie helped out with \"Magic.\" If anything, the themes of death, life, despair, faith and hope that run through the set, and the final sequence starting with \"Devil\'s Arcade,\" were amplified by the pace. The playing was nearly flawless, and Bruce\'s voice was in fine form. And that solo from Nils on \"Prove It All Night\" - put that one on brucespringsteen.net, please! If it was Bruce\'s intent to keep the audience out of breath and begging for more, it worked.\nBut just as fast as all the songs had been, that\'s how fast it was all over. Or so it seemed.\nThe techs came out to gather the equipment, with the roadies to follow to take down the stage. That was it. Some fans filed out, some celebrated the evening, and some, well, were asking \"What the #%&!?\"\nThat\'s when the roar went up from behind the stage, as Bruce and the band re-appeared -- with the house lights still on -- to re-take the stage. Fans rushed back to their seats, equipment was plugged back in, techs were sent scrambling. \"Kitty\'s Back\" was a lovely mess, with Max flubbing some of the opening beats, Clarence\'s tech struggling with the Big Man\'s neck strap, and an extended guitar solo from Bruce. They gave \'em a helluva time. And left \'em wanting more.\nINDIANAPOLIS, INThursday, March 20\nAs showtime approached in Indianapolis on Thursday, I thought, \"I\'ve never seen an E Street Band show without Danny Federici -- I wonder what this will be like.\" It turns out I still don\'t know what it\'s like. Danny\'s surprise appearance -- and really, who could have predicted he\'d show up in Indianapolis, of all places? -- made for an intensely emotional show about the ties that bind us. Bruce and the band came out hot, with tight rocking versions of \"Night,\" \"Radio Nowhere,\" and \"Lonesome Day,\" and then turned up the heat with a white-hot version of \"Gypsy Biker,\" with a screeching guitar solo from Steve. \"Magic\" and \"Reason to Believe\" put the big questions of the night on the table, about the lies we tell ourselves, the illusions we let ourselves fall for. But when Bruce started requesting that the folks in the pit hold up their signs and we ended up with a ragged-but-right \"Rendezvous,\" things broke open. The triple shot of \"Rendezvous,\" \"She\'s the One,\" and \"Because the Night\" were all passion and desire, what happens to us in the heat of the night when the lights go out and we struggle with our own lies and illusions, where we stumble and fall and can\'t make it right. \"Livin\' in the Future\" was the challenge that we wake up and not sleep through the destruction around us -- political or personal.\nAnd then Danny came out for \"The Promised Land,\" and all bets were off. Bruce and the band manage to make this song sound fresh year after year, but this performance, with Danny\'s organ crying out, driving the band, felt like I was hearing it for the first time. \"Take a knife, and cut this pain from my heart\" is the bargain we have to make to get to the promised land, a promised land with all the scars in the songs of the first half of the show, all the band\'s scars, all of the pain Danny must be going through. Then, release: \"Spirit in the Night\" and \"Sandy,\" sending us all the way back to the band\'s beginnings, played with love and soul. I hadn\'t heard \"Sandy\" since 1981 at the Philly Spectrum, and it took in all those years of following these guys around, looking for Bruce\'s new ideas, seeing how we were growing up together. Danny left after that. There was the potential for a letdown at that moment, given that we\'d gone so far back in the past, flirting with nostalgia. But in the run from \"Devil\'s Arcade\" to \"Badlands,\" Bruce drove back to the heart of this new show and Magic, putting all the hard questions back on the table about war and community, the spitting contest between us and the badlands. \"Long Walk Home\" made sure that we didn\'t get stuck in the past of \"Spirit in the Night,\" hanging out with Hazy Davey and the gang at Greasy Lake. It\'s going to take a lot longer to get home than the length of a Bruce Springsteen concert.\nDanny came back out for the encore, which we expected to be \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes.\" Bruce said that they were going to do the next one for Danny, and Roy played the opening notes of \"Backstreets,\" Bruce\'s greatest song about friendship. They soared. I stood there thinking about how hard it is to hold on to people over the years, and how important it is to weave together a community that can sustain you when your other reasons to believe fail. This music has challenged me to do it, and has given me sustenance when not much else was around, for most of my life. A scorching, swinging \"Kitty\'s Back\" -- with a killer guitar solo from Bruce -- reminded us that sometimes all we need to do is dance: \"Oo-oo what can I do?\"\nThanks to Bruce and the band for this one. Forever friends.\nDanny\'s Back in Town!\nThe Magic tour produced arguably it\'s greatest \"trick\" thus far, with the reappearance of Danny Federici at the Conseco Fieldhouse. Bruce and the Band clearly responded to Danny\'s presence on stage with a show spotlighting the Phantom on such classics as \"Spirit in the Night,\" \"Sandy,\" and \"Kitty\'s Back.\"\nDanny played in a three-song set in the middle of the show (\"The Promised Land,\" \"Spirit,\" and \"Sandy\") as well as the entire five-song encore, highlighted by Danny and Roy trading solos on the keyboards during \"Kitty.\" During Danny\'s time on stage, all of the E Streeters paid tribute by making their way over to the keyboard platform to play alongside their \"blood brother.\"\nBruce and the band were in the Spirit tonight in general, playing to the crowd and eagerly playing off their energy -- not to mention their signs. At one point, Bruce called out \"Let\'s see those signs!\" and responded to one from the pit by playing \"Prove It All Night.\" Later, after spotting a sign that called for \"Rendezvous,\" Bruce obliged by performing the Tracks rarity. During the encore, spotting a sign that read \"Dance with me,\" Bruce not only provided a rousing rendition of \"Dancing in the Dark\" but brought the young lady to the stage twice to dance and helped her back into the pit with a kiss on the cheek.\nClearly evident in Conseco tonight was the multi-generational appeal of Bruce and the Band. There were numerous examples of children and even grandchildren of long-time fans in the arena. In my own case, my family celebrated my wife Terri\'s birthday by attending the show together. My son Nick (and Amanda), my daughter Joanna (and Fred) and my grandsons Brennen and Carter all rocked to Bruce and the E Street Band!\nAfter a great night in Indy, for Terri and I it is off to Cincy for Saturday\'s show. I\'m not sure what Bruce can come up woth to top this evening but we can\'t wait to find out...\nMILWAUKEE, WISCONSINMonday, March 17\nThe Shamrock Shuffle, E Street Style\nThree songs into Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\'s St. Patrick\'s Day show in Milwaukee, I found myself nervous I would see a solid show, but one where the band coasted on material they knew like the back of their hand. As the ever-conventional \"Lonesome Day\" ended, Springsteen stood front and center and the E Street Band manically tore through the opening to \"Streets of Fire,\" a forgotten gem from Darkness on the Edge of Town. Unlike some performances of the song in 2003, this time an angry jolt paired with manic hydraulics from the band made the performance not just incendiary but flat-out devastating. This was one of these songs I never imaged ever seeing live, let alone having it be so unyielding and definitive. Ladies and gentlemen, this is why legions of fans travel far and wide to see Bruce Springsteen, because one never knows what magic may occur on any given night at any city in the world.\nMilwaukee has always had a rich history with Bruce Springsteen, from the infamous \"Bomb Scare\" show back in 1975, to being only the second region where he played an outdoor show (Alpine Valley in 1984), to the band\'s explosive penultimate stop of their 2003 tour, to the wondrous Devils & Dust concert where he aired five songs from Nebraska. Milwaukee has always been the Midwest version of Philadelphia to Springsteen -- I\'m not sure why, but the performances always seem to be a step above the rest. This St. Patrick\'s Day special was no exception.\nOn \"Streets of Fire,\" Springsteen\'s guitar work lit up the sky as the band oozed with determination and defiance. The performance of \"Gypsy Biker\" was elevated because of what had preceded, it proving that shaking things up and taking on a challenge can reap huge rewards. Feeding off of the energy from \"Streets,\" Van Zandt and Springsteen ventured into another realm on \"Gypsy Biker\" with some searing guitar work.\nThe revelations continued to unfurl all night. \"It\'s Hard to Be a Saint in the City\" found Van Zandt and Springsteen dueling once again, facing off like gun fighters from the Wild West to trade licks and riffs that congealed into a walloping crescendo. I somehow doubt this particular song was well known by more than half of those in attendance, yet somehow the crowd was there every moment of the way because of the band\'s chemistry and ability to raise their game. Even the warhorses that appeared sturdy yet tired a few nights earlier in Omaha were more fluid and free in Milwaukee: the faithful and fervent \"Prove It All Night,\" the blues-drenched \"Reason to Believe\" and the virtuosic victory lap of \"She\'s the One\" all hit the mark.\nYou should have felt the walls of the arena shake when the band\'s burbling hydraulics took the crowd to new heights during \"Cadillac Ranch.\" Springsteen didn\'t even need to sing as the crowd\'s voices soared beyond the walls of the arena onto the chilly Milwaukee streets. The adrenaline rush was similar to the one I felt in Convention Hall back in December 2000 when my friend Paul and I witnessed the band tear into \"Rosalita\" -- one of those perfect moments you wish you could bottle for\n'),('http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?r1406992924&w=2277468','2008-05-10 20:48:01','Skopje, May 9 (MIA) - Number of small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Macedonia is permanently increasing. This sector engages over 70 percent of total number of employees, thus being one of the main generators of economic growth, said Minister of Economy Vera Rafajlovska in the opening address of manifestation \"European Entrepreneur Day 2008\".According to Rafajlovska, the Government gives SMEs a crucial spot in its economic program.\"Although a large number of activities for SME development have already been realized, the Government puts priority on the intensive implementation of reforms in this sector, aimed at realization of larger economic growth\", stressed Minister Rafajlovska.EU Ambassador Erwan Fouere said visa regime liberalization would significantly facilitate the operations of Macedonian businessmen.He encouraged the Government to resume with the reforms, fight against corruption and creation of a better business climate, aimed at attracting foreign investments, \"which level is still under the average of regional countries\".In the framework of European Entrepreneur Day, several working sessions and conferences focusing on entrepreneurship development, cooperation between local and central authorities, and SME financing are to be held.\n'),('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:DiffusionOfInnovation.png','2008-04-28 15:05:25','Image:DiffusionOfInnovation.png - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nNo higher resolution available.DiffusionOfInnovation.png?

How much has MySpace, Facebook, Friendster, Twitter, LiveJournal and many others been offline? Read on to find out.\nThe monitoring for this survey was done using the Pingdomuptime monitoring service\nWe have included two tables, one with a summary of the downtime and uptime for the entire period, and another one which breaks down these numbers month by month.\nDowntime summary, January through April\nThis table is sorted so that the highest downtime is at the top. In other words, it is one of the few lists where it is a good thing to be near the bottom.\nSocial network site downtime, Jan 1 - April 30, 2008\n* Pownce has only been monitored since January 22, when the site went public.\nMySpace comes out on top, at least when it comes to website availability. Their website has only been unavailable for little over an hour so far this year. At the other end of the spectrum we find the Twitter website, which has been unavailable for more than 37 hours (a day and a half).\nOrkut, Facebook, Classmates.com, Yahoo! 360, LiveJournal, Xanga and MySpace all have a 99.9% uptime or better so far in 2008, which has to be considered very good.\nWe also added Pownce for monitoring on January 22, when the site went public. Pownce is Kevin Rose?s post-Digg social networking site. (The other founders are Leah Culver, Daniel Burka and Shawn Allen.)\nDowntime month by month\nSince we thought it would also be interesting to have a look at the downtime numbers on a monthly basis, we have included a table for that as well. We have sorted the sites just as above, so the largest total downtime is at the top.\nSocial network site monthly downtime, Jan - Apr, 2008\n* Pownce has only been monitored since January 22.\nThis monthly view shows us that the majority of Twitter?s website problems were in January and February (it still had more than seven hours of downtime in April, though). Of course, Twitter also relies heavily on the use of SMS, but we did not monitor that aspect, only that the website responded (just as we did for all the other sites in this survey).\nFriendster had the vast majority of its downtime in January, and has since then been very stable.\nBebo has, after a rocky January and February, stabilized their site significantly. AOL announced a deal with Bebo in March that it will acquire the social networkfor $850 million\nAs we have mentioned in the past, all websites have downtime sooner or later. Social networks, by their very nature, will have a lot of visitors who return to the site frequently, and a lot of page views per visitor, so any downtime they have tends to be highly visible to their users. With many of these social networks counting their user base in the millions, it is a significant technical challenge for these sites to keep downtime to a minimum.\nA note about the monitoring:All monitoring was done using Pingdom?suptime monitoring service. If a web page is not reachable, returns an error, or takes longer than 30 seconds to load, it is considered as down. Downtime is always confirmed from two geographically separate locations.\nFiled under:? royal @ 10:15 am\nPosted by the geeks at Pingdom.Believers in uptime, nice servers, good software and Jolt Cola.Learn more about us\nMail (will not be published) (required)\nComments are moderated and not published in real time.

But there?s a reason people associate the Victorians above all with morbidity and death, and one of them ismemento morilike this:The fact is, postmortem photographs like this were taken more than any other kind of photograph in the Victorian era ? especially in the U.S. ? and in many cases these carefully-arranged, meticulously staged pictures were the only ones ever taken of their subjects. From Stanley Burns? bookSleeping Beauty: Memorial Photography in America\nThese photographs were a common aspect of American culture, a part of the mourning and memorialization process. Surviving families were proud of these images and hung them in their homes, sent copies to friends and relatives, wore them as lockets or carried them as pocket mirrors. Nineteenth-century Americans knew how to respond to these images. Today there is no culturally normative response to postmortem photographs.\nSo, given your lack of a ?culturally normative response? to these pictures, dear reader, we advise the faint of heart among you to click elsewhere.\n?Child in Coffin at the Death Room?\nFrom: ?This portrait appears to have been taken in the formal parlor of a family home. The parlor, or ?death room,? was an important part of funerary rituals for most of the 19th century, the place where deceased family members were laid out for final respects. This image dates to c. 1890-1905, a time when many funerals were still taking place at home. Soon, however, death would begin to leave the home and by end of World War I most Americans will receive their health care in doctor?s offices and hospitals and most funerals will take place in funeral homes. As the funeral ?parlor? came into vogue, the home parlor was rechristened a ?living room.? A 1910 issue of Ladies Home Journal declared the ?death room? to be a term of the past.?\nAlso, did you notice the strange silhouette on the right side of the picture? That?s the photographer?s assistant, holding the casket lid open for the shot.\nFor me, though, more intriguing than the dead are the living who pose with them ? usually stoic and reserved, it?s the little bit of emotion their faces betray that make these portraits so compelling ? and heartbreaking. (Above and below: siblings with their brothers.)\nAnother common theme in Victorian-era postmortem photography was the staged scene of mourning, which was often highly melodramatic, like this one, ?Orphans at Their Mother?s Grave?:The photograph above also reveals another Victorian preoccupation: spirit photography. Likely a double-exposure featuring an ?actress? portraying the childrens? mother, this style seems to me a highly theatrical way to deal with one?s grief.\nAnother style was the photograph in which the dead were posed to look alive ? the first in this series, at the top of this post, is an ?eyes-open? example. The use of props like this man?s newspaper was less common; perhaps it was included to distract from the unnatural rigidness of his hands, among other giveaways.\nWow. We sure look at death differently these days. These photos remind me of the ?death photos? from the movie ?The Others?. Creepy yet fascinating\n5-6-2008 at 11:52 amposted byJaneMon\nI love these posts! Keep them coming. Does that make me creepy?\n5-6-2008 at 12:09 pmposted byCarmenon\nJaneM - I was just thinking the same thing about The Others. These pictures aren?t too bad except for the first one. Somehow having a dead person?s eyes open staring at you is eerily creepy? like they can see you.\n5-6-2008 at 12:10 pmposted byCKon\nStrangly people still actually do this. About 8 or so years ago I worked in the photo-lab of a local grocery store. The majority of the pictures we got were hunting photos with deer hanging from trees being gutted or photos of Granny at the funeral. Very weird. The worst one, and I?ll never get it out of my head, was one day trying to color balance a print. For those who don?t know, there is more to it than just sticking the film in and hitting print. Depending on how long the film sat around or what the light was like when the pictures were taken there is color correction to do, people can come out with a picnk or yellow or blue cast to them. Anyway I couldn?t get the baby in the picture to look any less yellow, then I realized he was dead. He was not in a coffin, just on a piece of black cloth. I had thought he was sleeping but when you looked clost there was something just not right about his face. So sad . . . not to be selfish, but I wish the people who brought that roll in had warned us, I was only 18 at the time and totally unprepated for something like that.\n5-6-2008 at 12:14 pmposted byEmon\nJane and CK ?\nYes, The Others uses these photos to great effect ? probably the scariest part of the film!\nposted byRansom Riggson5-6-2008 at 12:27 pm\nThat first kid seem like he?s staring at me. So creeped out.\n5-6-2008 at 12:30 pmposted byTriciaon\n@Em:I used to work in a 1-hour photo lab in a small town drug store. We routinely processed photos for the local police. I once saw a series of photos taken by the police of an elderly gentleman who had apparently dropped dead in his house. A couple of days later, in a non-police roll of film, the same old man lying in his casket.\nBoth sets of photos creeped me out. I could understand why the police would want the photos they had, but I didn?t know why anyone would want photos of the body at the funeral. Now it makes a little more sense.\nposted byOhne Hosenon5-6-2008 at 1:14 pm\nActually, there was a similar custom involving painted portraits of deceased loved ones.\nBecause painted portraiture and photography were both very expensive then, it?s not uncommon to find that a portrait from that era any sort occurred more often when a family member was deceased, especially if the individual was young. Unless the family was truly rich or in some way connected to an artist (photography or paint), families really couldn?t afford to create these sorts of stopped-in-time, tangible memories until after someone had passed on to keep them, in some small way, alive for the family.\nFollowing this note, a museum not too far off from my hometown boasts a life-sized painting of a little boy that was done from his momento mori. They have a copy of the small photograph near the painting, and in both his eyes are open.\nIt always gave me shivers.\nposted byACute Angleon5-6-2008 at 1:37 pm\nLast night, in my History of the Beatles class (Best. Class. Ever.), my teacher showed us a copy of the National Enquirer that he?d kept from the week John Lennon was killed. The cover had a picture of John in the morgue on it.\nPart of me didn?t really want to look at the picture - I would have much preferred to picture John alive in my head - but the other, morbid, part of me looked anyway.\nI know it?s not quite the same thing as these photos, but it was just kind of funny that this post came after seeing the picture last night.\n5-6-2008 at 1:45 pmposted byMelodyeon\n5-6-2008 at 2:22 pmposted byheatheron\nYes, the first picture creeps me out, but the girl standing with her dead little brother breaks my heart.

I admit, I have been photographed standing next to my grandmother?s open coffin. Definitely felt kinda weird doing that? I found it most difficult to decide what kind of somber expression to have on my face, however, after the photo was taken I looked at it only to see my sister smiling happily.\n5-6-2008 at 2:44 pmposted byAnneon\nI?m going to have bad dreams tonight, I know it!\n5-6-2008 at 3:08 pmposted bybethon\nMy grandmother takes pictures of people in their caskets. Then she shows them to everyone for months afterwards and says things like how ?beautiful? they looked.\nThey never look beautiful. They never look like themselves. I don?t get it at all.\nHowever, I also don?t get touching, hugging and kissing people in their casekts either. To me, once they are dead, the body is really nothing. Seems wrong to touch and hug all over it.\n5-6-2008 at 3:30 pmposted byKarenon\nPhotographs back in the day were very time consuming. Children and other folks would literally fall asleep while posing. Many postmortems of children are actually sleeping children. Caskets are pretty much the only way to tell if the subject is actually dead.\n5-6-2008 at 4:18 pmposted byChristyon\nMy Grandparents had a son born with an enlarged heart who died of pneumonia when he was 6 mos old.

Recently, my wife was asked by her cousin to take some photos of a dead relative (the cousins? mother) in her coffin. She needed them for some crazy reason and didn?t bring a camera?who could forget that!? Anyway, we were totally creeped out by her request and were left scratching our heads on that one?\n5-6-2008 at 4:42 pmposted byEricon\nWhile photos ?back in the day? did take longer to expose than today, in most cases it wasn?t long enough to fall asleep. Some photographic methods developed in the mid 19th century would have measured exposure time in seconds rather than minutes. So, if there was a lot of doubt about whether a child was sleeping or dead, the type of picture could lend a clue.\nHowever, the biggest clue is the numerous small children photographed who are alive. If the exposure time was so long that a child could fall asleep, movement during that time frame would make a very blurry picture. If you?ve ever tried to get a small child to sit still for a picture, you know this is quite a task. Given the number of clear pictures of living children taken during the era of the death photos in Ransom?s article, I?d have to argue that you could probably make some good guesses about living status without a casket in the picture.\nThough the casket undoubtedly helps. :)\n5-6-2008 at 4:56 pmposted bykateon\nBefore photography they would make a plaster cast of your dead face!\n5-6-2008 at 5:39 pmposted byDNAon\nBefore photography they would make a plaster cast of your dead face!\n5-6-2008 at 5:39 pmposted byDNAon\nI?ve seen some of the ones with the eyes painted open?very sad.

Civil War photographs are posed, views of where some battle had occurred, or photos of those killed. Studio portraits were posed using neck braces to help hold the subject in position, hence the regular ?grim? expressions. The actual exposure could be frelatively short, but the set-uop, including focusing would still take minutes rather than seconds.\nposted byGary Sargenton5-6-2008 at 10:25 pm\ngood lawdey Im glad times have completely changed.\n5-6-2008 at 10:36 pmposted byon\nAs I read it, I expected the last sentence to read: The use of props like this man?s newspaper was less common; perhaps it was included to distract from the unnatural rigidness of his hands, among other dead giveaways.\nposted bymr goatheadon5-6-2008 at 11:03 pm\nIt?s definitely a tradition among blacks to take pictures of the deceased either at the viewing or at the funeral. In my family, it?s not strange to stumble upon such pictures in an old photo album. When my great-grandma died, my mom sent my brother and I to the church early so that we could get pictures of her before everyone arrived. I always wondered why we kept pictures like that, but I guess since I grew up with it I never really questioned it. Also, we bought a picture of MLK, Jr. in his coffin that we bought as a souvenier in Tenn.\n5-6-2008 at 11:14 pmposted byCarmenon\nDeath simply is.It?s not scary unless you don?t understand which world you are living in.\n5-6-2008 at 11:16 pmposted byon\nKeep in mind that photography wasn?t an everyday event like it is today.

They explained they had just made a big score at a \"World of Warcraft\" tournament and wanted to get some relaxation. On noting the boys age the delivery clerk informed the authorities.\nWhen police arrived at the motel they found $3,000 in cash, numerous electronic gadgets, an Xbox video console with numerous games, and the two local escort girls.\nRalph had reportedly told police that his father wouldn\'t mind, as it was his birthday last week and he had forgot to get him a present. The father, a lawyer said he had been too busy, but would take him on a surprise trip to Disneyland instead.\nAsked why he ordered two escorts, Ralph said he thought it was the thing to do when you win a \"World of Warcraft\" tournament. They told the suspicious working girls they were people of restricted growth working with a traveling circus, and as State law does not allow those with disabilities to be discriminated against they had no right to refuse them.\nThe $1,000 a night girls sensing something up played \"Halo\" on the Xbox with the kids, instead of selling their sexual services.\nRalph\'s ambition is to one day become a politician.\nMONEY SAVING TIPS EMAIL\nKeep updated with the latest money saving tips, tricks, deals and loopholes.

He\'ll probably grapple with his rabbit ears and pound the side of his aging CRT, but no amount of cajoling will bring back Ice-T\'s interrogation room or Richard Belzer\'s last unfunny stand. That\'s because on Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2009, the FCC will repossess the analog spectrum from the major television broadcasters and the networks will go all-digital.Most of us get our television reception from either cable or satellite and will therefore be unaffected by the change?but 17 million U.S. households still rely upon analog, over-the-air broadcasts for their TV. If those viewers don\'t upgrade to digital televisions or purchase digital converter boxes, they will no longer be able to access standard broadcast channels (although many low-power UHF stations will continue on in analog).The prospect of good, honest, television-loving Americans losing their signal has caused a lot of hand wringing of late. According toa January survey by the National Association of Broadcasters, 79 percent of Americans are aware of the transition. That number is up from 38 percent the previous year, but it still means that 21 percent of the citizenry has no clue that the country is about to go through a wrenching technological change with its most massive of mass mediums.A recentNew York Timesarticlecites a study estimating that 9 million households could lose one or more stations, even if they do get converters.All this despitea huge information campaignand an incentive program that amounts to an investment by American taxpayers of up to $1.5 billion. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a division of the Department of Commerce, is offering 33 million coupons at $40 each toward the purchase of a converter box, with a maximum of two per household. (Amazon is currently selling a Sansonic FT300A, for example, at around $59, which would make the total cost to a consumer less than $20). Ironically enough, the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act was part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.That, to me, raises the question: Do Americans have a right to television? I asked this recently of spokespeople from the FCC, the NAB, and the NTIA and received reactions ranging from puzzlement to outright hostility.The question is not meant to be cynical. There is, after all, a public-interest rationale for as many people as possible to have access to the television medium?in fact, it\'s the sheer number of people who have access to television that makes it such a powerful technology. According to Nielsen Media Research, 98.2 percent of American households have a television. By some measures, that even beats the penetration rate of basic adult literacy skills, which was last pegged in 2003 at 86 percent (to be sure, a comparison between households and individuals is inexact at best, but the statistic is still jarring). So when it comes to getting the word out for emergency alerts, public service announcements, news, election information and educational programming, there\'s no more effective distribution method.Nevertheless, it would be naive to think that television\'s primary function in most households is as an emergency alert or learning tool. And it\'s illuminating to put the government\'s $1.5 billion allocation in perspective. Consider: The proposed 2009 federal budget for adult basic and literacy education is $574.6 million.My point here is not to say that the federal government cares more about TVs than books?it\'s only to point out just how surprisingly important it currently seems to be to the nation\'s well-being that every American have TV access. It made me wonder if our elected officials are as concerned about ensuring that we all have access to broadband Internet. Turns out that thereisa massive federal program to stimulate the growth of broadband?administered, oddly enough, by the Department of Agriculture, which throughits Rural Development programhas approved 85 loans totaling $1.68 billion since 2002 to help fund broadband infrastructure rollout in underserved areas.Is nationwide availability of speedy Wikipedia queries as important as delivering Ryan Seacrest digitally to your living room? I leave that to you, dear readers, to decide.\n9. RE: Digital Transition Looms, but Do Americans Have a Right to TV?What\'s silly is that the only \"TV\" people need is their computer and an internet connection. That\'s where everything is going. And that\'s the only place where people who want liberty will want to consume content.8. Digital Transition Looms, but Do Americans Have a Right to TV?I think the fcc is stuppid for rushing into this move they just want the money by auctioning off the spectrum. I still only have analog and I think its junk to buy sattilite. Got a new digital TV plugged her up and wow we get one channel ONE channel we had 8 before on analog so i guess next febuary i\'ll be on youtube to watch TV because the FCC screwed up.7. RE: Digital Transition Looms, but Do Americans Have a Right to TV?I\'m still of the belief that this change was being \'encouraged\' with cable company money. Cable companies are already handed monopolies over service areas, and this measure as well as the increased broadband access will only further their stranglehold over those service areas.6. Remote ControlTV is vital to pacify and control the population. That is worth much more than $1.5 billion. That\'s why they put them in prisons, too.5. RE: Digital Transition Looms, but Do Americans Have a Right to TV?There\'s a good reason why every American needs access to television... how else would politicians get out their messages? Especially during election periods.4. RE: Digital Transition Looms, but Do Americans Have a Right to TV?The financial numbers may be a comparison of apples and oranges. By definition, only the Federal government is responsible for the communications spectrum, but adult literacy is the responsibility of the Federal government and state/local governments, the latter spending much more on education than the Feds do. However, this does not negate your question re whether we have a right to television. 30 years ago, when we all agreed that television was a public service, there would be no question that we did have such a right. However, there is more of an attitude that television is an activity of private companies and not necessarily a public service. But if television is a private enterprise, then why is government paying for the education? Good question.3. RE: Digital Transition Looms, but Do Americans Have a Right to TV?Aren\'t you comparing a one-time spending item (although a boondoggle) with an ongoing \"flow\" variable, namely the annual spend on adult education? If so that undermines the substance of the central thesis of the article.2. RE: Digital Transition Looms, but Do Americans Have a Right to TV?While I agree with what you are saying overall, there is one major element that you are overlooking. The Revenue that will be generated by selling off this currently private spectrum. This money is essentially found money in that the only thing the government needs to do to earn it (and this is actually optional if you think about it) is make sure that the public doesnt see a change. Yes they are spending about 1.5 billion (your own number) but the government is going to make something like 9 billion (pretty sure thats right, but its safe to say the actual figure is at least 3 times the 1.5 billion they are spending on awareness) all of which could be applied to whatever social cause they see fit. So when you make a big political statement like you are here, at least awknoledge all of the sides to the argument.1. RE: Digital Transition Looms, but Do Americans Have a Right to TV?Do americans have a right to TV? Prison inmates do. I find that a little odd. I do not have TV (by choice). Sometimes I think the government should pay for my cable... Heh.\nPlease enter the characters shown below:\nMake sure your comment is relevant to the topic discussed.

Part 1 wasThe Whatchamacallit, Post Recession Phase Transition\nRecessions change consumer behavior, drive weak businesses and models to the wall and enable new businesses and models to thrive. This recession is likely to have a greater impact on Web ventures than past recessions for two reasons:\nThis is the first recession wherethe Internet is the primary driving force for almost every business, big and small as well as millions of free agent individuals. In the last recession, many traditional businesses breathed a sigh of relief that all the craziness was past. You would have to have your head buried very deep in the sand to take that view now. Online is the only way forward. This makes the stakes very high for everybody, not just a few people in tech/media.\nGlobalization is kicking into a higher gearduring this recession. America is at the epicenter this time and Asia is the best hope for a growth engine. In the last recession, globalization meant large companies cutting costs by outsourcing. In this recession, globalization means revenue opportunity and it means cost cutting by individuals and small businesses through ?personal outsourcing?.\nThis means that thestakes are high for a lot of people. During the Dot Com era, a few visionaries were surrounded by financial opportunists who convinced public market investors to become VCs.After the crash, engineers and real entrepreneurs reclaimed the Net and celebrated that as Web 2.0. That sense of being an elite community, where everybody knows anybody who matters and knows what they are doing, is about to be obliterated by the Main Street Web.\nThere are two consolations. First, we can finally let go and stop trying to follow every feed from everybody. Second, the Main Street Web will have sustainable business models that allow millions of people to make a good living and a few people to get rich beyond the dreams of avarice.\nThe Dot Com era handed thepower to individual consumers to research prices. That was a massive and irrevocable shift in the balance of power between buyer and seller. The Web 2.0 era, social media, extends that power. We can nowcollectivelyresearch prices and, even more important, we can take action collectively. In a recession, when everybody gets real about saving money and making additional income, we will use this power. Social media taught everybody that we had the power - we could write as well as read, create as well as consume, take action to change the world as well as observe changes in the world.\nIn the new web era, we will use that power to make a living\nThat is why I call this new era theMain Street Web. This is a nod to Geoffrey Moore?sCrossing The Chasm, the point in the adoption cycle when technology goes mainstream. The Main Street Web is about people who don?t care about technology or media, they just use it. Above all it is about really simple business models that work in the physical world as well as online world. The Main Street Web will empower small business and level the playing field with big business.\nThe Main Street Web is all about revenue, fixing the one big weakness of Web 2.0\nThis is not just about revenue for the founders/investors who own the site, but for the millions of ordinary people who use it. This will be the ?show me the money era?.The way for Main Street Web ventures to make money is to help other people to make money.This is when the digital sharecroppers revolt and new entrepreneurs will come forward to give them a fair shake. In a recession everybody needs revenue. Small businesses need revenue. Digital free agents need revenue. The only people who don?t need revenue are employees with a solid paycheck from a big company, and as layoffs hit the news they will also be doing a bit of moonlighting and looking at options.\nBoring technology, exciting business\nClay Shirky vividly describes, inHere Comes Everybody, how technology gets socially interesting at the same time as it gets technically boring. The basic tools of Web 2.0, such as forums, blogs, Skype, SMS, RSS and social networking have now passed the early adopter phase and crossed into the mainstream. Ordinary people are using social media to change their world.\nShirky focuses on social change and does it brilliantly. He does not focus as much on the lower levels ofmassconomy? Fortune 500.\nWe went, in a heart-beat, from ?this stuff will change the world? to ?yippee, this is new way to sell mass produced products to consumers online?. That is the Dot Com era on steroids vision that made Facebook?s Beacon a massive embarrassment. ?Coca Cola wants to be your friend? is not the next phase of the web!\nIf digital creations are free, how do digital free agents make money?\nThis era also taught us that all digital products (code, data, writing, video, photos, music and so on) tend towards ?free to air?, because the Internet is a giant free copy machine. There is still room to sell subscriptions to large companies as they will use these services to replace the layers of legacy products and the massive maintenance and management teams dedicated to serving them. There are still huge enterprise budgets up for grabs in legacy replacement by SAAS (Enterprise 2.0, if you like). But for consumers and small businesses, the monetization of digital products will be through advertising or e-commerce.\nThere is plenty of advertising $$$ that wants to go online. The gap between 20% of time spent online versus 5% of ad $$$ spent online is still the big wave driving all this. The problem is not availability of budget, it is effective ways to spend it.\nMost of that advertising will not be for more free digital products - that would create a shell game. (Yes, in the final days of Web 2.0 there is a lot of that shell game going on). So eventually we have to have some physical products that users crave/need/want.\n?Green e-commerce? and rising gas prices\nThis is where it gets interesting and a bit more complex. Digital products are simple. The whole process of creating craving and fulfilling craving takes place online. Physical products have to travel in the real world, using trucks and planes and they need to be handled by lots of people. With rising gas prices, trucker strikes and increased awareness of eco damage from carbon emissions, the e-commerce 1.0 model looks seriously flawed. The Internet is brilliant at surfacing the long tail. You can find that wonderful extra virgin olive oil from a small producer in Italy. But ordering a single bottle, picked and packed just for you by the same people who grow the olives, sent on a transatlantic jet and finally delivered 24 hours later just in time for your dinner party? Some people can afford to do that, but it is no longer hip. The rest of us cannot afford to.\nE-commerce 1.0 is the unprofitable part of Amazon (all those expensive warehouses with inventory). It failed dramatically at Webvan. It was always a problematic model. High gas prices and eco awareness just dealt the coup de grace. A new ?green e-commerce? is needed. Orders need to be aggregated and delivered through a local hub and spoke supply chain.\nMom & Pop get hip\nLuckily we already have a local hub and spoke supply chain. They are called independent retailers, the ones sprouting up again in the Main Street cracks left by the big box chains. Those big box retail chains, with their standardized supply chain processes, create long delays between spotting a trend and meeting it and limit their ability to to customize and localize. The independent shops - the once derided Mom & Pops - have the agility and direct, real customer relationships to prosper with a bit of help from new online infrastructure.\nIndependent retailers thrive by aggregating long tail demand at the local level\nThis has to be about long tail products, what ordinary people call ?exotic? or ?special? or ?unique?. This can mean hand-made, which is whatEtsyis doing. It can mean local food from sustainable agriculture farms. Or custom motorbikes, fancy cashmere sweaters and other cool stuff that mass affluence has taught us to want and expect. This is about the emergingglobal micro-brands\nIndependent retailers make a living by offering products that you cannot find in the big box chains. Most have adapted to the waves of Wall Mart, CVS and other bland megastores by selling what the big guys don?t have. Sure they have to offer some basic staples as well, but consumers go to the independents because of the fun of finding something different and special. And having a human connection with somebody who knows your name or at least your face. You cannot - thank goodness - replicate that, automate it, or turn it into a platform.\nIt is a marriage made in heaven. The Internet is very good at long tail. Independent retailers need long tail products to differentiate.\nThe Internet is clearly good at surfacing long tail products. With a little extra technology, the Internet could connect some dots to deliver tremendous value (read ?extra income?) to the 3 key players in this emerging Main Street Web - the independent retailers, the digital product creators and the global micro brands.\nThe elusive revenue model for social networking?\nThis is where social networking sites may find an enduring revenue model. Possibly. They have already found what does not work - helping friends to sell massconomy products to their friends in a glorified online Amway scheme. What would be much more in keeping with the peer ethos would be to enable friends to get together to buy cooperatively. General Motors really, really wants to spend more ad $$$ online because the young car buyer is getting so hard to reach in other media. Say 1,000 Facebook users, all of whom wanted a new car, agreed on a specific model so they could bulk order and get a discount? GM would be happy, after getting over the enraged calls from the dealers. They would find ways to keep the dealers happy, the buyers have to pick the cars up somewhere local.\nThat sounds good, but the problem for social networking sites is that this is not about friends. If I want that discount on a new car, I don?t really care who my fellow buyers are. They don?t need to be friends. In fact it would be pure coincidence that my needs happened to coincide with the needs of my friends.\nSo this is about content more than about friends\nBut the content has to be structured to enable this to happen. Which sounds like a reasonable mission for all that cool Semantic Web stuff brewing in start-ups. This is where thatimplicit webandsocial browsingtechnology seems to be headed.\nGet local (even ?hyperlocal?)\nIt also has to be local. Remember, it has to get delivered in a way that makes sense for carbon/gas cost.\nWhat on earth does ?hyperlocal? mean? Is this ?hype about local?. Or ?what techies call local to make it sound cool?? ?Local? is good enough.\nLocal, as a tech/media opportunity, has tended to mean local advertising. RememberMicrosoft Sidewalk? over $100m spent to take on the $100 billion local advertising market. This was one of many attempts. The problem is that Craigslist took the air out of that market. Traditionalists continue to use Yellow Pages and local newspapers, but they arefighting a losing battle,while Craigslist moves rapidly into the mainstream andGoogle has a shot at a big chunk\nEverybody else will have to work a bit harder to deliver value to local businesses. Selling ads alone won?t cut it. Small businesses are used to a simple world of orders and margins. How many of these will you buy at what price? This has to be e-commerce and not just ads. But it has to be green e-commerce, aggregating long tail demand at the local level.\nNow that enough people are online, the chance of finding other people locally who are interested in that product becomes a bit more reasonable. It needs some smart software to surface demand at that level of specificity - for that long tail product in that area and wanting it now - but given the scale of the prize, the technology will come.\nEnter the digital content creators\nThis is where the digital content creators come in. They find the cool stuff, write about it, take pictures, interview the workers who make it, review it, create videos to explain it. They can do this on behalf of the global micro brands, being paid to create marketing materials directly for Giovanni?s Olive Oil. This will happen through free agent webs and exchanges. Or they can do this as independentmicro-media, writing/videoing about the subject they are passionate about in a commercially independent way (an expert on Olive Oil who may write a negative review of Giovanni?s Olive Oil)\nAdding some structure to the content provided by the digital content creators is where semantic web technologies can help. What has been described as ?SEO 2.0? means that the long tail media expert tags the content semantically, so that Giovanni and his competitors can more easily find which long tail sites to advertise on. Which means that the provider of the toll booth - Google primarily - may not be able to charge quite so much. Yahoo seems to be focused on this opportunity.\nGet real about ROI and monetization - its called revenue and orders\nThe next step is to make the monetization much more direct. CPM is a hold-over from traditional media. Re-reading the very entertainingBurn Rate, it was weird to see the Web cognoscenti in 1995 saying that CPM was not going to last, knowing that in 2008 it is very much alive and well. CPC is better, but most small businesses don?t have the engine to monetize clicks. Cost Per Action sounds better, but what Giovanni really needs is Cost Per Revenue. Or to put it more simply, orders.\nMore importantly he needs orders in a reasonable volume for delivery to a specific retailer.\nWhich means that the olive oil expert with his rich media blog has to also have an API that syndicates that data to all the places on the web where people who might be interested in olive oil hang out and also ensures that he makes some money when orders get placed.\nThat is one scenario for how this could play out. The goal of aggregating long tail demand at the local level is not simple to achieve. So this scenario may not be what happens. But I am convinced that emerging phase of the Web, what I call the Main Street Web, will be about:\nSimple revenue models, orders not clicks, suitable for small businesses and individuals.\nLeveraging and empowering independent retailers to compete with big box stores.\nEnabling global micro brands to grow and take bigger share from the massconomy.\nReducing costs by cutting out physical intermediaries such as distributors.\nReduced cost for seller, lower prices for buyer and more income for digital content creators from new technology that reduces the toll booth fee from the platform operator (known today as Google).\nSmall business - the neglected middle child\nSmall business has been the neglected middle child - neither big companies with big budgets nor billions of individual consumers. Entrepreneurs don?t know whether to treat small business as a scaled down enterprise or a scaled up consumer. That will change. Small business is on a major upswing.\nBefore the Internet and during the Dot Com era, entrepreneurs spent a lot of time courting big companies, as that was the quickest way to get a return on R&D. That style of enterprise selling went out of fashion in the Web 2.0 era for good reason. It is very hard to build sustainable advantage selling to large companies. This is the lesson learned by anybody who sells to Wallmart. You become a commodity vendor and the big company is always looking to replace you with a cheaper alternative and you have very little leverage when that time comes. Better to have 10,000 small clients than 10 big ones.\nSo we moved to the opposite extreme and sold to consumers. In a consumer recession thats a problem.\nSmall business is due for a comeback, powered by the Internet\nIn 1955, Fortune 500 companies accounted for around 1/3 of GDP in America. By 2000, that share had risen to 2/3. To put it another way, the share of the economy controlled by large companies doubled from 33% to 66%.\nImagine a world where the Fortune 500 share of GDP went back to 1/3 and small businesses got back the 1/3 they lost in the last 50 years. That maybe about to happen for 4 reasons:\nand the Internet. Coase?s law could become as famous in tech/media as Moore?s law. The main point is simple. Large firms exist because transaction costs make it cheaper to organize within the firm. The Internet obliterates transaction costs, fundamentally threatening the single rationale of economies of scale.The glue holding together big companies was the fact that external transactions cost too much. The Internet changed that.\nand the hunt for ?special?. Big companies are great at mass production. Small companies are better at meeting the wealthy demand for niche, special, exotic and customized.\nThe decline of Fortune 500 as employer of choice. There used to be a trade off. You could the take security of a big employer and face a bit of boredom or choose the wild, scary ride of a start-up, the risks of small business or the uncertainties of the free agent life. Waves of reengineering, downsizing and other restructuring translated to workers as a simple message; ?don?t rely on us for your paycheck any more?. Profit follows talent.\nThe availability of capital. Yes we are in a bit of a funding squeeze right now but that is cyclical.

They quickly dominated radio call-in shows, with listeners advised to beware of fellow passengers in communal taxis wearing gold rings.\nPurported victims, 14 of whom were also detained by police, claimed that sorcerers simply touched them to make their genitals shrink or disappear, in what some residents said was an attempt to extort cash with the promise of a cure.\n\"You just have to be accused of that, and people come after you. We\'ve had a number of attempted lynchings. ... You see them covered in marks after being beaten,\" Kinshasa\'s police chief, Jean-Dieudonne Oleko, told Reuters on Tuesday.\nPolice arrested the accused sorcerers and their victims in an effort to avoid the sort of bloodshed seen in Ghana a decade ago, when 12 suspected penis snatchers were beaten to death by angry mobs. The 27 men have since been released.\n\"I\'m tempted to say it\'s one huge joke,\" Oleko said.\n\"But when you try to tell the victims that their penises are still there, they tell you that it\'s become tiny or that they\'ve become impotent.

She also authorsHug the Monkey,\" a blog about how oxytocin and other neurochemicals affect our daily lives.\nSubmitted byon 28 April 2008 - 9:00am.\nThere\'s an old joke in the gay community: What does a lesbian bring on the second date? A U-Haul. What does a gay guy bring? A friend.\nGay women, according to the stereotype, are all too ready to move from fiery romance to feathering the nest. And what follows is Lesbian Bed Death, a warm, cuddly, committed but asexual relationship.\nOf course, this is a stereotype. Throngs of old-married lesbians have sizzling sex lives, while scads of gay men enjoy monogamous relationships that Ward Cleaver would envy. Still, thereissome neurochemical truth to this joke.\nCertainly, gay men and lesbian women love and bond the same way as straight people do: During sex and orgasm, their brains produce spurts of oxytocin andexciting rushes of dopamine. Oxytocin is the neurochemical of generosity, trust and social memory. The interaction of oxytocin and dopamine in the brain\'s reward system ties the pleasure of sex to that particular partner, creating the bond we call love.\nIn gay love, however, the lovers\' systems are more alike than those of a heterosexual pair. Most important, estrogen enhances the bonding effects of oxytocin, while testosterone mutes them. While the effects of orgasm\'s oxytocin surge may last for hours in a woman\'s body, they may clear from a man\'s body in just a half hour.\nWhen two women have sex, the oxytocin surge can induce cuddling that lasts for days. Two male lovers, under the heavier influence of testosterone, may quickly feel ready to move on physically and emotionally after love-making.\nIn addition to the match in brain chemistry in same-sex couples, there\'s evidence that one partner -- gay or straight -- can absorb the other\'s sex and bonding chemicals; in a same-sex couple, this could heap on an extra helping of estrogen or testosterone.\nMost mammals have a special area in the nose called the vomeronasal organ. This sensitive tissue, located in the nasal passages, sends molecules that the animal inhales directly to the brain, where they can influence behavior. This organ reacts to pheromones, the chemical signaling substances put out by animals from insects to apes. It\'s the organ that draws a female elephant to the musth secreted by a bull in his prime.\nHuman fetuses have a vomeronasal organ, and for a long time biologists thought that it was a vestigial structure that disappeared by birth. But recently, researchers have found evidence that the human response to pheromones is alive and well in adults. This is the organ that seems to be responsible, for example, for the tendency of women living together to synchronize their menstrual cycles. More sex and bonding chemicals may be exchanged via lovers\' sweat and saliva, according to preliminary research by Cameron Muir of Brock University. How we react to the chemicals coming off another person\'s skin seems to be related to our sexual orientation. These studies certainly do not prove anything about neural differences in gays and straights, but they make it clear that people of all sexual flavors do react to the neurochemicals they swap when they kanoodle.\nThis effect in a gay couple may reinforce their neurochemical states. With every nuzzle, taste and touch, a same-sex pair creates a neurochemical feedback loop that reinforces the tendencies of their sex.\nWhen two women engage in intimate behavior, from hanging out with a friend to wild love-making, it\'s likely that, with every breath, they take in molecules of estrogen and oxytocin emitted by the other\'s body -- as well as the testosterone women produce. Two men enjoying the same behaviors likely inhale each other\'s testosterone and oxytocin -- along with some estrogen, which is part of the male hormonal mix. Overall, two women may experience more oxytocin in their relationship than a man and a woman; two men may experience less.\nIt\'s crucial to note here that the wide range of temperaments and tendencies in men and women certainly extends to gays and lesbians. Men gay and straight may find it extremely easy to bond, while women of all sexual persuasions run the gamut from runaround to stay-at-home. All of us, gay and straight, bond the same way. And every relationship is bathed in a unique neurochemical soup.\nBut be aware that the neurochemistry of a lesbian love may nudge the relationship further toward the sedate. You can counteract this tendency by building some -- safe -- danger into your life. An adrenaline rush counters that oxytocin calm nicely. So, if you feel your relationship becoming a little too comfortable, grab some chocolate and wine and head for an exciting getaway.

Wizardry!\nSubstitute teacher Jim Piculas does a 30-second magic trick where a toothpick disappears then reappears.\nBut after performing it in front of a classroom at Rushe Middle School in Land \'O Lakes, Piculas said his job did a disappearing act of its own.\n\"I get a call the middle of the day from head of supervisor of substitute teachers. He says, \'Jim, we have a huge issue, you can\'t take any more assignments you need to come in right away,\'\" he said.\nWhen Piculas went in, he learned his little magic trick cast a spell and went much farther than he\'d hoped.\n\"I said, \'Well Pat, can you explain this to me?\' \'You\'ve been accused of wizardry,\' [he said]. Wizardry?\" he asked.\nTampa Bay\'s 10 talked to the assistant superintendent with the Pasco County School District who said it wasn\'t just the wizardry and that Picular had other performance issues, including \"not following lesson plans\" and allowing students to play on unapproved computers.\"\nPiculas said he knew nothing about the accusations.\n\"That... I think was embellished after the fact to try to cover what initially what they were saying to me,\" he said.\nAfter the magic trick, Rushe\'s principal requested Piculas be dismissed. Now, Piculas believes the incident may have bewitched his ability to get a job anywhere else.\n\"I still have no idea what my discipline involves because I\'ve never received anything from the school district actually saying what it entails,\" said Piculas.\nAs a substitute teacher, the Pasco County School District considers Piculas to be an \"at will employee.\" That means the district doesn\'t need to have cause for not bringing him back at all.\nJanie Porter, Tampa Bay\'s 10 News\nA Pasco County substitute teacher\'s job is on the line, but this time it\'s because of a magic trick.

Maybe they have the population but what about the ad-spending and e-commerce transactions.\nAzhar - check out the later slides in the presentation that talk about mobile use in asia. amazing growth.\nThe social web, invincibly, and, globally.\nAlso there is tremendous growth in internet users that open market for e-commerce transactions and other business sector.\nIs the traffic and monetisation potential from widgets (and API?s) being underestimated as a trend here, eg, where do RIAs such as Twhirl using Twitters API fit in?\nSurely applications like this have huge growth potential using platforms such as Android and iPhone SDK?\nshould be ?YouTube + Facebook page views > Google OR Yahoo page views?\nChart 15: ?less intrusive ads? is one of the reasons why facebook is growing faster than MySpace\nLess intrusive??? mhhhhhhh? ;o)\nGoogle takes in more advertising rev than all others combined ex. Yahoo. That?s just stupid. Google + YouTube = Everybody Else Loses\nSmall clarification to your post:\nLive.com is not a social website (assuming they are referring to the search engine Live.com). But MySpace (obviously) is. The slide in question that you pulled the key takeaways from (#8) is highlighting sites which moved on or off the top 10, not those who are social. Since MySpace was in the top 10 in 2005, it is not highlighted in the slide.\nthanks for sharing the report, great information to decission makers in the 2.0\nQueen?s quality, always a good read..\nSlide #25- MySpace is simply more popular in the US. Why doesn?t google follow the principles they pioneered; less intrusive advertising leads to better acceptance and conversion.\nMorgan Stanley pandering for money?.What Chinese Wall?\nEver wonder about Facebook?s valuation? Wonder no more: >50% of the 64MM+ users return DAILY. Remember last week, Yahoo! made a big deal about how their new strategy will create ?stickiness?? they are dreaming about a day where they have Facebook-like participation.\nSocial networking is the trend!\nBTW, would you like join the lucky draw for USD 30,000? All you have to do it click, click, click?\nThat was possible the best thing i have scene in ages i loved it, especially cause i am finishing my business plan .. THANK YOU!\nYes Mike, i went through the slides, Really informative.I don?t know about other Asian countries, but i would like to talk about India. Mobile penetration is huge here, when i say huge, people who don?t know what an mail id is have a blackberry. People who earn less than $150 have a mobile phone here.Now to the other question, do mobile penetration really convert into higher page views or more revenue for publishers or companies?Like i said most of the low earning people have a mobile phone here, We have a lifetime incoming plans here for $25. That means he just has to buy a $40 phone and $25 plan and he is connected for life. So even when the penetration is huge, he does not become a valuable customer, he does not browse internet, he does not buy things through his phone, he is using it for just being connected.\nI am wondering it is the same story in China and Brazil too.\nMost data revolves around Alexa?Its not at all reliable, or is it? I thought even you didnt believe in Alexa statistics\n@Azar, Thanks for bringing that perspective. I agree, and it drives me crazy that people treat disposable income across various countries the same. ?eyeballs? differ in value and the advertisers (Fortune 500) know this from my experience.\nMorgan Stanley, Mary Meeker, the Internet is going to be big, big, big - is this Deja Vu 2.0 - Hang on to your savings\nPorn industry still tops them all - 35%!\nWhile facebook ads are ?less intrusive? what are thoughts on the click-through and saliency of the ad. I love facebook (and now with facebook messaging) I?m on the site everyday. But I am rarely ever paying attention to any of the advertisements as they seem to be somewhat disconnected from the content ? unless the ad is related to my school, etc. Thoughts?\n@17 Azhar: Most of what you say is true except for ?he does not browse internet, he does not buy things through his phone?. Value Added Services, Ringtones, Games, Wallpapers (and a lot more) for a mobile phone has a huge market in India. (Agreed that the revenues are not comparable with that in US or elsewhere in the world because of currency conversion.)\nMobile version of any website has a better chance of reaching a Indian user compared to a normal website.\nHasn?t this trend been going on for a few years now?\nGood tips and informative.\n16% of total time online is spent on ?social connections,? up from 0% three years ago\nThe ?category didn?t exist 3 years ago?? These people must either only define categories for the sake of their own chart or have their heads deep in the sand. Friendster and MySpace were both popular three years ago, as well as LiveJournal and FriendsReunited, all very popular ?social connections? sites.\nConnect to the right people otherwise social networking sites can be an enormous waste of time.\none ugly presentation designCouldn?t they come with some other color then dark blue?\nbut how soon can the social sites monetize this traffic? facebook?s projected revenue growth was uninspiring.\nlol yeah that was an ugly presentation design but there was great information in that presentation ? Most of the facts are rather simple and self-explanatory considering we all know the effects of social media, but seeing it in stats form will help many companies sell even more ads to businesses looking for ad platforms as well as social media optimization/marketing\nDan, FB has nothing on Y!?s stickiness.\nVisits/month per user:Y!

From around the web or from your own machine. And with more intelligence and metadata extraction/understanding which makes it easier to organize and find your information. Or discover information of interest to you as there?s a lively bunch of people (and AI) on there already recommending information.\nSo I?m pleased to announce that I have invitation tickets for interested readers & supporters of Think Artificial. Getting a nice productivity tool ahead of about 40,000 people waiting to get access.\nHow to Get an Invitation\nThose that are likely to contribute to the active development and growth of both Twine (and a new extension of Think Artificial within Twine) will be more likely to receive invites. The following are the two ways to get invites.\nComment- 20 hand-picked readers that comment on this post will receive an invitation. Comment should indicate what it is about the service that interests you, and/or why you?d like an invite. The email you enter in the comment field is the email I?ll send an invite to.\nWrite an entry- 30 hand-picked writers will receive an invitation by writing an entry on theFuture of the Web in the Next 2-5 yearslinking back here to Think Artificial.Send me an emailwith a link to your article and specify an address to send the invitation to if its not the one you sent from.\nI always enjoy when people think ? there?s never enough of that. So in the second point, I?m (ab)using my position in recruiting the masses to spread thought-worthy issues and ideas.\nIn the event that I get an overwhelming amount of comments, I?m going to limit the selection to the first 60 commenters. I simply don?t have time for more. And regarding the articles, they must be new ? not from your archives! And selection will be based on quality - meaning entries that are well written and present personal perspectives.\nThe ?beta? tag on Twine is not a Perpetual Beta where the tag is slapped on as a beforehand-apology for any user discomfort. But ?beta? in it?s original meaning: It?s a product in the making, incomplete, getting active user feedback and making improvements.\nHere are some qualities I recommend you have to enjoy Twine:\nOnline activity experience- I?m looking for people that enjoy finding and sharing data. Regular use of Del.icio.us, StumbleUpon, Digg, Flickr, YouTube or Blogging is a plus.\nPatience- With Twine in a beta status, lack of a feature or the disfunction of a present one can be keyboard-through-the-monitor frustrating. Patience equals suggesting improvements.\nVision and Ideas- It?s a plus to have shown a public interest in innovative web services, and/or having publically posted original articles on how we use the web. As mentioned above, I like (getting to know) people that like to think and contemplate the future.\nI see potential for Twine to bloom in bright colors. And for the Web to boom with acumen. We just need determined people to get the gears in the right places.\nIf you?re not one of those that make the cut this time ?stick around. You?ll may get another chance. I?ll continue to keep an eye out for cool people after this round ends on April 29th.\nFinally, I mentioned something about a Think Artificial twine. It?s an experimental place inside Twine where like-minded people ? we ? can collaborate on harvesting and discussing aesthetic loaded, machine riddled and intelligent content.\nPretty and attractive tickets!\nI?ve read the French translation of your precedent post about ?Why I Migrated Over to Twine (And Other Social Services Bit the Dust)? on the blog of a friend (link herehttp://xtof.livejournal.com/20729.html).I really trust this friend, and I specially ?over-trust? him when it?s about microformats or other semantic-related subjectsSo, I think that if he spent time to translate your post (a very good one I have to say), it?s enough motivation for me for being impatient and trying to have an invitation for the beta.\nI could ad that I?m 100% with you concerning the interest and the ?power? of the process of a real beta and the interest of living a beta VS all the ?pseudo? betas that just have the name beta.For mapovino, the main project I work this time, we try to take the more juice of the beta, and we?ve just started planing some ?beta-tastings?, that are kind of IRL meeting during the [real] beta where we share about the project, features, feedback etc. while we also taste some good wine (yes, this is a wine related project!). There will be more about this beta-tasting experiment on betatasting.com very soon.\nMy last point is that we are going slowly with mapovino but/because we have on our priorities to be the most ?semanticly intelligent? we can.We want microformats everywhere, we want to organize the ?social network? side of the project in regard of what is discussed about DiSo, data portability and other stuffs like that, and I think that experimenting Twine could bring at least some sane ideas, and may be more with possibility for using some APIs between mapovino and twine (e.g. for bookmarks).\nAnd here is the short comment: please, I?d love [beta] tasting [T]wine!\nFirst off - wonderful re-design. I?ve been following your blog via RSS for a while now and had not noticed the change. I particularly enjoy the featured posts banner at the top? Ok, now on to my twine audition!\nI?m a doctoral candidate in Environmental Psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center and a certificate candidate in Interactive Technology & Pedagogy. My research (both professional and academic) concerns young people?s interactions with new technology in educational environments (http://gregorydonovan.org/cv.html). My dissertation largely focuses on the semantic codification of young people?s everyday life - looking specifically at how young people produce, consume, circulate and evaluate digital information across race/gender/class. Young people?s concept of privacy and ?openness? in such an informational environment is also a major theme of my research.\nI?m also a blogger (http://cyberenviro.org) and an avid user of facebook, del.icio.us, Flickr, Last.fm, twitter, youtube, etc? I?ve tried to construct my blog as an aggregator for my various research-related online activities. This is perhaps most visible in the ?digital footprint? section of my blog, where I?ve tried to organize all of my RSS feeds (http://gregorydonovan.org/cyberenviro/social-feed/). I setup my blog to function as both an epistemological tool for the development of my dissertation and as a space for playing around with the various ways information can be consumed/produced/circulated/evaluated online. Which brings me to why I?d LOVE a twine account?\nWhat looks so interesting about twine is the way it is fully embracing the semantic web (or attempting to fully embrace). I?ve completely given up on MySpace, Friendster and Orkut - and facebook just barely interests me, its essentially the best of the worst. Having a chance to participate in the beta version of this social network would be a valuable peek into the ways cyber-sociality and knowledge production might operate in the near future. Also, being part of a community that is playing around with OWL, RDF and Semantic Graphs would give me some much needed experiences from which I could situate my somewhat abstract understanding of the semantic web.\nOK - that?s it for now. I?m writing this from a cafe and my battery is about to die?\nMebbe now is my chance to get out google reader and comment..\nthe blog design is pretty cool .. good work on posts\nok, before twine.. i am working in UCD dublin for my phd research in the field of image analysis n tagging and semantic / ontologies techniques .. if it gives some idea that i have been involved in semantic techniques and have tested few other websites which have been trying to collaborative or semantic or other similar ways like powerset labs search, recently also tired pageonce. thou its not that exciting as it has no actual ML/semantic web\nand per twine.. i have heard about it for sometime now and the most interesting part of their work as far as i have read in webware or other sites, is the use of semantic web techniques like RDF etc.. thou not sure how much of it actual of use in real life scenario and would love to see what sort of things they are testing. Another thing i read was about giving tags (i love tags :).. i have to thou .. its my research topic) to stored items, if i am correct, on twine.. and what kind of usefulness they have in twine and if its gives useful recommnedations based on user tags and semantic graphs?\nok gotta rum, FC barcelona playing MU..\nhope to get n try twine ..\ngood work on blog again.. keep it up\nI am very interested in the what Twine proposes to do. Information has always been difficult to manage. Now that everyone on the Internet can author content there is that much more to take into consideration.\nNew approaches to searching and making results more productive and rewarding is something a lot of developers are concerned with. I am interested in learning more about how innovations such as Twine, microformating, and other semantic web solutions will affect how I work with data.\nPart of my professional responsibilities include knowing how technology is being used for meaning making. Staying informed is a large part of what I need a tool like Twine for.\nI would love an invitation to participate in the Twine beta.\nThank you for your site and for the opportunity.\nhey-always enjoy to read what you find the new and useful in this new century.

Reprinted from \"Film Quarterly\" Vol. 53, no. 3, by permission of the University of California Press.\"So... do you... do you suppose we should... talk about money?\"ALICE: And, you know, there is something very important we have to do as soon as possible.\n-Dr. William (\"Bill\") Harford\nCritical disappointment with Eyes Wide Shut was almost unanimous, and the complaint was always the same: not sexy. The national reviewers sounded like a bunch of middle-school kids who\'d snuck in to see it and slunk out three hours later feeling horny, frustrated, and ripped off. Kubrick was old and out of touch with today\'s jaded sensibilities, they said. The film\'s sexual mores and taboos, transplanted straight out of Arthur Schnitzler\'s fin-de-siecle Vienna--jealousy over dreams and fantasies, guilt-ridden visits to prostitutes, a strained discussion of an HIV test that echoes the old social terror of syphilis--seemed quaint and naive by the standards of the sordid year 1999. One last time Stanley Kubrick had flouted genre expectations, and once again, as throughout his career, critics could only see what wasn\'t there.\nThe backlash against the film is now generally blamed on its cynical, miscalculated ad campaign. But why anyone who\'d seen Kubrick\'s previous films believed the hype and actually expected it to be what Entertainment Weekly breathlessly anticipated as \"the sexiest movie ever,\" is still not clear. The most erotic scenes he ever filmed were the bomber refueling in Dr. Strangelove and the spaceliner docking in 2001. He mocks any prurient suspense in the very fist shot of this movie; without prelude, Nicole Kidman, her back to the camera, shrugs off her dress and kicks it aside, standing matter-of-factly bare-assed before us for a moment before the screen goes black like a peepshow door sliding shut. (You can almost hear the director\'s Bronx-accented voice: \"You came to see a big-time movie star get naked? Here ya go. All right, show\'s over. Can we get serious now?) The main title then appears like a rebuke, telling us that we\'re not really seeing what we\'re staring at. In other words, Eyes Wide Shut is not going to be about sex.\nThe real pornography in this film is in its lingering depiction of the shameless, naked wealth of millennial Manhattan, and of its obscene effect on society and the human soul. National reviewers\' myopic focus on sex, and the shallow psychologies of the film\'s central couple, the Harfords, at the expense of every other element of the film-the trappings of stupendous wealth, its references to fin-de-siecle Europe and other imperial periods, its Christmastime setting, even the sum Dr. Harford spends on a single night out-says more about the blindness of the elites to their own surroundings than it does about Kubrick\'s inadequacies as a pornographer. For those with their eyes open, there are plenty of money shots.\nThere is a moment in Eyes Wide Shut, as Bill Harford is lying to his wife over a cellphone from a prostitute\'s apartment, when we see a textbook in the foreground titled Introducing Sociology. The book\'s title is a dry caption to the action onscreen (like the slogan PEACE IS OUR PROFESSION looming over the battle at Burpelson Air Force Base in Dr. Strangelove), telling us that prostitution is the basic, defining transaction of our society. It is also, more importantly, a key to understanding the film, suggesting that we ought to interpret it sociologically--not as most reviewers insisted on doing, psychologically.\nMichiko Kakutani of the New York Times tells us that Kubrick \"never paid much attention to the psychology of characters, much less relationships between men and women,\" and in fact \"spent hiscareer ignoring (or avoiding) the inner lives of people, their private dreams and frustrations.\" [] Unable to imagine what other subjects there could be, she, like so many critics before her, shrugs him off as obsessed with mere technique. She is, first of all, wrong; Kubrick examines his characters\' inner lives through imagery, not dialogue; as he said, \"scenes ofpeople talking about themselves are often very dull.\" [] (It could be argued that almost all of this film takes place inside Bill Harford\'s head.) Secondly, and more importantly, she misses the point: Kubrick\'s films are never only about individuals (sometimes, as in the case of 2001, they hardly contain any); they are always about Man, about civilization and history. Even The Shining is not just about a family, as Bill Blakemore showed in his article \"The Family ofMan,\" but about the massacre of the American Indians and the recurrent murderousness of Western civilization. [\nReviewers complained that the Harfords were ciphers, uncomplicated and dull; these reactions recall the befuddlement of critics who complained that the computer in 2001 was more human than the astronauts, but could only attribute it (just four years after the unforgettable performances of Dr. Strangelove) to human error. The Harfords may seem as naive and sheltered as the Victorians in, say, Galsworthy\'s Forsyte Saga, but to wish that the characters had been more complex or self-aware misses the point. To understand a film by this most thoughtful and painstaking of filmmakers, we should assume that this characterization is deliberate--that their shallowness and repression is the point. Think of Bill in the back of the cab, his face a sullen mask as he tortures himself by running the same black-and-white stag film of Alice\'s imagined infidelity over and over in his head. (Anyone who doubts that it is the character, rather than the actor, who lacks depth and expressiveness should watch Cruise in Magnolia.) Or of Alice giggling in her sleep, clearly relishing her dream about betraying and humiliating her husband, only to wake up in tears, saying that she had \"a horrible dream\"; her repression is complete and instantaneous. (She\'s like Jack Torrance in The Shining waking up shouting from \"the most terrible nightmare I ever had,\" about chopping up his family, about twelve hours before he actually tries to do it.) The itensely staged vacuity of the Harford\'s inner lives should tell us to look elsewhere for the film\'s real focus.\nOne place to look is not at them but around them, at the places where they live and the things they own. Most of the film\'s sets, even the New York street scenes, were constructed on sound stages and backlots, just like the Overlook Hotel, which was as central to The Shining as its actors. Precision of visual detail is as integral to the meaning of Eyes Wide Shut as is the use of gorgeous faces famous from the covers of glossy check-out-aisle magazines to play a conspicuously attractive high-society couple (not unlike his choice of handsome, bland-faced Ryan O\'Neill to play eighteenth-century social climber Redmond Barry.) Even the street sets (criticized by the uniquely provincial New York press as \"inaccurate\") are expressionistic, with newspaper headlines (LUCKY TO BE ALIVE) and neon signs (EROS) foreshadowing and commenting on the action. In Kubrick\'s work, nothing is incidental.\nStephen Hunter of the Washington Post mentions that the Harfords\' apartment \"must have cost $7 million,\" but only to make fun of Kubrick\'s apparent disconnection from contemporary America. [] But the meticulously rendered setting of the film, the luxurious apartments and sumptuous mansions, are meant to raise eyebrows. Kubrick and his collaborator,Frederic Raphael, discussed exactly how much money a New York doctor like Bill Harford must earn per year. [] The Harfords\' standard of living raises questions about their money, and where it comes from--from Bill\'s sparsely scheduled private practice, or the sorts of under-the-table services we see rendered upstairs at the party? Dr. Harford is on call to that class of person who can afford not to wait in emergency rooms or die in hospitals--people like his friend Victor Ziegler, whose name denotes him as one of the world\'s winners. Bill uncomfortably tries to compliment the prostitute Domino\'s apartment by calling it \"cozy\" (and her use of the standard joke \"maid\'s day off\" to excuse the leftovers and mess only draws further awkward attention to the class gulf between them), but his own place looks cramped and cluttered compared to Victor\'s. Ziegler\'s house is reminiscent of the Overlook Hotel, with its vast ballrooms and grand staircases, its mirrors and gilt, its bedroom-sized bathrooms. And even Ziegler\'s place seems modest compared to theopulent Moorish palace of Somerton, where the secret orgy takes place (in Schnitzler\'s novella it is \"a one-story villa in a modest Empire style.\" []) To some extent, the fact that no critics recognized this as deliberate is excusable; we\'ve all learned to overlook the fantastic affluence of the sets and wardrobe in most movies and TV shows, just as black audiences had, for decades, to try to ignore the oppressive whiteness of everyone onscreen. But make no mistake: this is not a film about the \"private dreams and frustrations\" of what Victor condescendingly calls \"ordinary people\"; it is about really rich people, the kind that Lord Wendover in Barry Lyndon and Mr. Ullman in The Shining call \"all the best people.\" And it shows us that these people are empty and amoral, using their social inferiors as thoughtlessly as if they were possessions, ultimately more concerned with social transgressions like infidelity than with crimes like murder--just as the film\'s audience is more interested in the sex it was supposed to be all about than the killing that is at its core.\nThere\'s no reason to assume we\'re expected to like Bill and Alice Harford (in fact, Kubrick once told Michael Herr he wanted to make a film about doctors because \"everyone hates doctors.\" []) They don\'t, like typical Hollywood villains, literally slather or speak with foreign accents. The Harfords are what we think of, uncritically, as \"nice\" people--that is to say, attractive and well-educated, a couple who collect art and listen to Shostakovitch. But evil among our elites is more often a matter of willful ignorance and passivity--of blindness--than of any deliberate cruelty. And Kubrick emphasizes that culture and erudition have nothing to do with goodness or depth of character; in this film they have more to do with the exhibitionistic display of imperial wealth.\nThe paintings that cover the Harfords\' walls from floor to ceiling (painted by Kubrick\'s wife Christiane) almost all depict flowers or food, making explicit the function of art in their environment as mere décor-art for consumption. Most of them probably come from Alice\'s defunct gallery, which brokered paintings like any other commodity. (Helena, the Harfords\' daughter, helps her mother gift-wrap a massive collection of paintings by Van Gogh--the icon of an artist who died in obscurity but whose reproductions on calendars, ties, and coffee mugs now make quick millions for the canny marketers in the museum industry.) The Harfords aren\'t the only art--lovers in the film; the apartment of Bill\'s patient Lou Nathanson is decorated with even more expensive objets d\'art (and his bedroom, like the hall outside the Harford\'s apartment, is wallpapered with imperial French fluers-de-lis); Victor Ziegler has a famous collection, including antique china arrayed in glass cases, a soaring winged statue of Cupid and Psyche in his stairwell, and, reputedly, a gallery of Renaissance bronzes upstairs; and the house in Somerton is hung with tapestries and oil portraits of stern patriarchs, and decorated in appropriated historical styles from Medieval to Moorish to Venetian to Louis XIV. Like the trashed mansion of the renowned playwright and pedophile Clare Quilty in Lolita, these people\'s houses are tastefully stacked with the plundered treasures of the world.\nThe film\'s elegant, antique appointments, its opening waltz, and its cast full of European characters (Sandor Szavost, the models Gayle and Nuala, the Nathansons, Milich, the maitre d\' at the Sonata Café) all blur the distinction between Millennial Manhattan and fin-de-siecle Vienna, another corrupt and decadent high culture on the brink of an abyss. In the champagne haze of Victor\'s party the 1990s and 1890s become one, just as the \'70s and the \'20s merged in one evening at the Overlook Hotel. But the comparison is not only to the European capitals of the Gilded Age; a broad sweep of references establishes America\'s continuity with a number of previous imperial periods. Sandor Szavost, Alice\'s would-be seducer, inquires whether she has read Ovid\'s Art of Love, a reference fraught with sly implications. Art of Love is a satiric guide to the etiquette of adultery, set among the elite classes of Augustus\'s Rome, full of advice about bribing servants, buying gifts, and avoiding gold-diggers. (Szavost\'s drinking from Alice\'s glass is a move lifted right out of Ovid\'s pick-up manual.) And the fact that Ovid was an exile from his own center of empire further links him to the expatriate Hungarian. Szavost\'s extraordinary skill at the Viennese waltz, and his offer to show her Ziegler\'s collection of sculptures, extend the instances of imperially--sponsored high art from the Latin poetry of Rome to the ballroom dance of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the plastic arts of the renaissance, bringing them all up to date in New York\'s glittering, art-encrusted façade.\nWhile Alice resists Szavost\'s courtly come-ons, her husband is called away to the scene of a less polished assignation, where Kubrick shows us what lies behind that façade: unadorned exploitation and death. Behind the scenes at Ziegler\'s party, in an upstairs bathroom, Bill Harford finds the same thing Jack Torrance finds in room 237 of the Overlook, and that Private Joker confronts at the end of Full Metal Jacket: a woman\'s body. Banal dance music echoes from downstairs as we see the call girl Mandy sprawled naked in a narcotic stupor, while Victor hurriedly pulls up his pants, his use of her having been interrupted by an overdose. (Or has it?) After Bill brings her around, Victor impresses upon him that this near-scandal has to be kept \"just between us\"--but Kubrick, our own contemporary American artist-in-exile, in his own bitter Art of Love, tells all. With every detail and allusion he exposes the base, exploitative impulses behind imperial high culture: the erudite Szavost uses the classics, ballroom dance, and Renaissance sculpture as so many lines and props to seduce another man\'s wife, while Victor, looking distractedly down at Mandy as she lies naked and twitching, isframed by a painted nude. Asked about Alex\'s fondness for Ludwig Van in A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick answered, \"I think this suggests the failure of culture to have any morally refining effect on society. Many top Nazis were cultured and sophisticated men, but it didn\'t do them, or anyone else, much good.\" [] This point is reprised overtly in Eyes Wide Shut when we hear the title of a Beethoven opera used as the password to an orgy.\nAs omnipresent as the art in the film\'s backgrounds are its Christmas decorations. It isn\'t incidental that the story is set at Christmastime; Schnitzler\'s book, which the script follows closely in most other particulars, is not (it takes place \"just before the end of carnival period\"). [] Stanley Kubrick seems to have gotten seriously into the Yuletide spirit in his last film. Hardly an interior in the film (except the Satanic orgy) is without a baubled Christmas tree. Almost every set is suffused with the dreamlike, hazy glow of colored lights and tinsel. In the film\'s first scene, the Harfords\' daughter Helena wants to stay up to watch The Nutcracker on TV. And its denouement takes place in the toy section of a decidedly upscale department store, where they\'ve taken Helena Christmas shopping. Eyes Wide Shut, though it was released in summer, wasthe Christmas movie of 1999.\nThere is a chain of allusions to the Judeo-Christian fall-and-redemption myth throughout the film: Alice\'s allegorical dream about being \"naked,\" \"terrified,\" and \"ashamed,\" and fucking \"in a beautiful garden,\" the Harford\'s Edenic apartment crammed with plants and paintings of gardens, the two temptresses at Ziegler\'s party, twined and undulating like serpents, practically molting out of their glittering skintight gowns, the picture of an apple with a single vaginal slice cut from it on the wall of the prostitute\'s kitchen, and the self-sacrificial \"redemption\" ritual at the orgy. This all seems like unexpectedly old-world symbolism coming from a famously atheistic director whose films all take place in a modern, Godless universe. (The most memorable Christian imagery in Kubrick\'s previous films are Alex\'s ceramic chorus line of can-canning Christs and his Hollywood-epic daydream about being a centurion who gets to flog Him in A Clockwork Orange. And in that film it\'s clear that Christianity is just a less effective version of the sadistic, Skinnerian Ludovico treatment.) But these Biblical references only serve to show us how bankrupt the Christian ethic is in America by the end of the second millennium A.D., how completely it\'s been coopted and undermined by commerce. As Ziegler angrily tells Bill in their final confrontation, \"That whole play-acted \'take me\' phony sacrifice had absolutely nothing to do with her real death!\" No, her death had more to do with the cult of secrecy and power at the heart of wealth--in other words, just business.\nIn Eyes Wide Shut, much as in the real world circa 1999, Christmas is less a religious observance than an annual orgy of consumerism, the ecstatic climax of the retail year. MERRY CHRISTMAS banners hang in places of business alongside signs reading NO CHECKS ACCEPTED and THANK YOU FOR YOUR CUSTOM. Rows of Christmas cards are on display in Bill\'s office below a not particularly merry sign saying, \"Payment is expected at the time of treatment unless other arrangements have previously been made.\" These juxtapositions undercut the supposed significance of the holiday and reveal the real nature of the season, its ostensible warmth and sentimentality belied by the bottom line. Even Milich, the Scroogelike owner of Rainbow Costumes, calls holiday greetings to the two men who have just come to \"another arrangement\" concerning the use of his daughter. The whole movie is brimming over with the spirit of the season. The equation of Christmas with crass desire is made explicit by the song heard in the Gillespie Diner: \"I Want a Boy for Christmas.\" The Nutcracker is the story of a little girl whose toy comes to life and turns into a handsome prince, which the Harfords\' daughter Helena wants to stay up to watch. \"Christmas shopping\" with Helena turns out to mean letting her run around picking out items she wants exclusively for herself.\nThe Harfords themselves (like most of the film\'s reviewers) don\'t really see their surrounding mise-en-scène--their wealth, their art, the ubiquitous Christmas glitz. They\'re preoccupied instead with their own petty lusts and jealousies. But again and again Kubrick visually links his characters to their settings, indicting them as part of the rarefied world in which they live and move, through which his relentless Steadicam tracks them like an omniscient presence. At Ziegler\'s ball, the starburst pattern of lights on the walls is echoed by the lace edging of Alice\'s gown and by the blue stelliform ribbon on Szavost\'s lapel. Bill is haunted wherever he goes by the colors blue and gold, the color of the wallpaper outside his apartment. Domino first appears in a black-and-white striped fur coat, a pattern repeated in the zebra skin stool at her dresser and the coat of the plush tiger on her bed. These people are as much commodities as the art and décor-that is, everyone can be bought.\nAlice\'s obvious resentment of her husband, which she only expresses when she\'s dreaming or drugged, is motivated by her unconscious recognition that she is a kept woman. We know Bill\'s supporting her, her art gallery having gone broke. She tells Szavost that she\'s looking for a job, but we don\'t see her looking; mostly we see her being looked at. Alice\'s role as a voyeuristic object is defined by her first breathtaking appearance and by her first onscreen line: \"How do I look?\" (And it rankles her that her husband doesn\'t see her anymore--he tells her that her hair looks \"perfect\" without even looking, and asks her the babysitter\'s name about twenty seconds after she\'s told him.) Everyone she encounters in the first fifteen minutes of the film compliments her appearance; Bill dutifully tells her she always looks beautiful, the babysitter exclaims, \"You look amazing, Mrs. Harford,\" and she\'s also flattered by such admirers of beauty as Victor Ziegler and Sandor Szavost. Ziegler tells her she looks \"absolutely stunning--and I don\'t say that to all the women.\" \"Oh, yes he does,\" retorts his wife--a joke that resonates unfunnily when we find out who \"all the women\" associated with Ziegler are.\nBeing beautiful is Alice\'s job, as much as it is the former beauty queen and call girl Mandy\'s or the hooker Domino\'s. During the quotidian-life-of-the-Harfords montage, in which her husband examines patients at the office, we only see Alice tending to her toilette: brushing her daughter\'s hair, regally hooking on a brassiere, applying deodorant in front of the bathroom mirror. Hers is the daytime regimen of a courtesan (or an actress), devoted to the rigorous maintenance of her looks. She\'s associated, more than any other character, with mirrors; we see her giving herself a critical once-over before leaving the party, and look of frank self-assessment in the medicine cabinet when she decides to get stoned. Her expression in the mirror as she watches her husband making love to her (the film\'s iconic image) begins as bemusement, giving way to fondness and arousal, but in the last seconds before the fade-out it becomes something more ambiguous, distracted and self-conscious; this is her moment of clearest self-recognition, an uncomfortable glimpse of what she really is.\nAlice\'s real status is unmistakably suggested: the wife as prostitute. She\'s identified with the hooker Mandy through a series of parallels: they\'re both tall redheads with a taste for numbing drugs, we first see them both in bathrooms, and Mandy\'s last night \"being fucked by hundreds of men\" is distortedly echoed in Alice\'s dream. Alice is also associated with the streetwalker Domino by the purple of her sheets and Domino\'s dress, and by their conspicuous dressing-table mirrors (the essential accoutrement of anyone who lives by her looks). Mandy and Domino are connected, as in dream-associations, by the identical consonants of their names, just as Alice is connected with Domino\'s roommate Sally (their names being aural anagrams). When Domino disappears, she\'s replaced by Sally the next day, just asin dream-logic one person may turn into another yet remain the same. In a sense, there is only one woman in the film. Lee Siegel sees the various prostitutes that Bill meets as different incarnations of his wife, the woman he\'s really seeking all along. [10] But the similarities between them are more revealing (if less romantic) when read the other way--as insinuating that Alice is just another, higher-class whore. When we last see her in the film, in that toy store, she\'s surrounded by shelves full of stuffed tigers like the one on Domino\'s bed. (Kubrick also used tiger and leopard-print patterns in Lolita as a code to connote Charlotte Haze\'s predatory sexuality.) Even in this scene, as she delivers the film\'s ostensible moral, Alice is visually linked to a doomed hooker.\nShe\'s also grooming her daughter Helena (named after the most beautiful woman in history) to become a high-ticket item like herself. During the montage of their day at home, we see Helena alongside her mother in almost every shot, holding the brush while her mother gathers her hair into a ponytail, brushing her teeth at the mirror, learning to groom herself. When we overhear her doing word problems with her mother, she\'s learning how to calculate which boy has more money than the other. We hear her reading a bedtime story aloud, reciting the line, \"...before me when I jump into my bed.\" In this film, a line about \"jumping into bed\" can\'t be innocent. Her mother silently mouths it along with her, echoing and coaching her. At Bill\'s office, we see a photo of Helena in a purple dress, like the one worn by the girl her father paid for sex the night before.\nLike his wife, Bill Harford is defined by his first line: \"Honey, have you seen my wallet?\" She is a possession; he is a buyer. (\"Doctor Bill,\" as both his wife and Domino call him, is a pun, like Jack D. Ripper or Private Joker.) He flashes his credentials and hands out fifty- and hundred-dollar bills to charm, bribe, or intimidate cabbies, clerks, receptionists, and hookers--all members of the vast, compliant service economy on whom the enormous disparities of wealth in America are founded. Including (unconsummated) prostitution, costume rental, assorted bribes, and cab fare, his tab for a single illicit night out totals over seven hundred dollars. He does not seem fazed by the expenditure. His asking Domino \"Should we talk about money?\" his repeated insistence on paying her for services not quite rendered, his extended haggling with Milich and the cab driver--all these conversations about cash are too frequent, drawn-out, and conspicuous to be included in the interest of verisimilitude. They do not occur in the novel. Doctor Bill is nothing if not a conspicuous consumer; he even tears a hundred-dollar-bill in half with a smirk.\nBill\'s nocturnal journey into illicit sexuality is, more importantly, a journey into invisible strata of wealth and power. Money is the subtext of sex from the very first temptation of Bill; the two models who flirtatiously draw him away from his wife at Ziegler\'s ball invite him enigmatically to follow them \"Where the rainbow ends.\" At that moment he\'s called away, saying to them, \"To be continued...?\" After he\'s gone, the two models exchange a cryptic, conspiratorial look. The exchange foreshadows Bill\'s finding himself at Rainbow Costume rentals--\"to be continued,\" indeed. We never find out exactly what the models meant, but everyone knows what lies at the end of the rainbow.\nThe colorful arc of Bill\'s adventure does lead to the pot of gold, Somerton, the innermost sanctum of the ultrawealthy where the secret orgy is held. The orgy scenes in particular were singled out by reviewers for disappointment and derision. Listen to the groans of critical blueballs: David Denbycalled it \"the most pompous orgy in the history of film.\" [11] \"More ludicrous than provocative,\" said Michiko Kakutani, \"more voyeuristic than scary.\" [12] \"Whose idea of an orgy is this,\" demanded Stephen Hunter, \"the Catholic Church\'s?\" [13] Again they misunderstood Kubrick\'s artistic intentions, which are clearly not sensual. When Bill passes through the ornate portal past a beckoning golden-masked doorman, we should understand that we are entering the realm of myth and nightmare. This sequence is the clearest condemnation, in allegorical dream imagery, of elite society as corrupt, exploitative, and depraved--what they used to call, in a simpler time, evil. The pre-orgiastic rites are overtly Satanic, a Black Mass complete with a high priest gowned in crimson, droning organ and backward-masked Latin liturgy. What we see enacted is a ceremony in which faceless, interchangeable female bodies are doled out, fucked, and exchanged among black-cloaked figures, culminating in the ritual mass rape and sacrificial murder of a woman.\nThe haunted ambiance here recalls that of the film\'s other big exclusive party, Zieglers; the opulent surroundings, the mannered, leaden dialogue, the camera afloat like the disembodied point of view in a dream. A ballroom full of naked, masked couples dancing to \"Strangers in the Night\" recalls not only Ziegler\'s party but the Overlook Hotel, whose ghosts also danced and coupled in costume. (Remember the quick, surreal zoom shot in The Shining of someone in a bestial costume fellating tuxedoed millionaire Horace Derwent in an upstairs room?) The two occasions, the party and the orgy, are conclusively linked in the back room of Rainbow Fashions, a sort of antechamber to Somerton, where we see a row of masked and costumed mannequins posed in front of the same cascade of glittering white lights that hung from the walls at Ziegler\'s.\nThe orgy makes the metaphor of sexual objectification visually literal. The prostitutes wear masks that render them anonymous and identical. Their nude bodies are unnaturally perfect, smooth and immaculate as mannequins, lit under a chilling white spotlight and photographed with that Kubrickian detachment that somehow desaturates them of any real eroticism. The ritualistic kisses exchanged are spooky and sterile, the sculpted white lips of one mask touching another\'s. The sex consists of static tableaux of spectators posed around mechanically rutting participants. A masked and tuxedoed valet on all fours serves as a platform for a fucking couple, a piece of human furniture like the tables at the Korova Milk Bar in A Clockwork Orange. One might remember, with a shudder, the Lugosian-toned Szavost inviting Alice to have casual sex upstairs, among the sculptures.\nThe masks worn by the revelers (Venetian--an allusion to another mercantile empire) serve a similar symbolic purpose: the transformation of the wearer into a soulless object. They certainly aren\'t expressive of ecstatic self-annihilation, as some critics suggested; they\'re creepy as hell. We see a bird with a scythe-like beak, a cubist face fractured in half, contorted grimaces and leers, a frozen howl, painted tears, blindly gazing eyes. These revelers have \"lost themselves\" not in erotic abandon but in the same way that the recruits in Full Metal Jacket lose their Selves, along with their hair and their names. The utterly still, silent shots of staring masks at Bill\'s \"trial\" are images of empty-eyed dehumanization, faces of death. Note that when Ziegler first sees Bill enter the ceremonial hall, even though they are both masked, he gives him a knowing nod. He recognizes him. Here the guests at Ziegler\'s party are unmasked for what they really are.\nMasks and mannequins are a recurring motif in Kubrick\'s work: think of the fight with mannequin\'s limbs in Killer\'s Kiss, the anthropomorphic furniture at the Korova, the grotesque masks worn in The Killing and A Clockwork Orange. In Eyes Wide Shut we see them not only at the orgy but throughout the film, always as harbingers of death. A stone Greek mask keeps vigil by Lou Nathanson\'s deathbed. African masks gaze down, like the masked spectators silently watching the sex acts at Somerton, at the bed where Bill has his interrupted trick with the HIV+ hooker Domino. A \"domino\" is itself a kind of mask.\nThey also serve as metaphors for women being treated like possessions. Costumed mannequins surround Bill and Milich in the back room at Rainbow Costumes. \"Like life, eh?\" says Milich, just before he catches his daughter consorting with two men in wigs and livid makeup. Milich\'s daughter, for all the coquettish depravity at play in her face, looks somehow as eerily inanimate as the Grady twins in The Shining--her skin is smooth and white as the mannequins in the back room, her painted lips and glittering eyes flawless as a china doll\'s. In a carefully composed shot in the scene when Bill returns his costume, we see Milich and his daughter paired on the right side of the frame opposite Bill and one of the mannequins (seen through the door to the back room) paired on the left. \"If Doctor Harford should ever need anything else,\" says Milich, hugging his daughter close beside the cash register, \"Anything at all... it needn\'t be a costume.\" The line only reinforces the visual equation of the girl with the store\'s more legitimate merchandise. And the three times we see Mandy her face is always a mask: in Ziegler\'s bedroom, her eyes are lit to look like empty black holes in her face; at the orgy she is literally masked; and on the slab at the morgue her face is slack and white, here eyes wide open but sightless.\nAlthough Bill doesn\'t actually fuck or kill anyone himself, he is implicated in the exploitation and deaths of all of the women he encounters. (Like the sign over the Sonata Café says... \"The customer is always wrong.\") He didn\'t give Domino HIV, but she contracted it servicing someone like him. Milich alternates with hilarious aplomb between berating the men he\'s caught with his daughter--\"Will you please to be quiet! Can\'t you see I am trying to serve a customer?\"--and unctuous apologies to Harford, conflating the two exchanges. (After all, Bill isn\'t just paying for a costume but for the illicit opportunity it affords.) And does it really make a difference whether Mandy was ceremonially executed by some evil cabal or only allowed to O.D. after being gang-banged again? Given Kubrick\'s penchant for blackly humorous literalism (think of \"Gentlemen, you can\'t fight in here--this is the War Room!\" or \"I said, I\'m not gonna hurt you--I\'m just going to bash your brains in\"), when Ziegler explains that Mandy wasn\'t murdered, \"she got her brains fucked out,\" the contradiction should be obvious.\nBill learns about Mandy\'s overdose in a café whose walls are covered with antique portraits of women, while Mozart\'s Requiem plays. The setting and the music make the moment timeless, universal. Kubrick\'s last three films form a sort of thematic trilogy about our culture\'s hatred of the female. In The Shining, Jack Torrance despises his wife and child and tries to murder them, just as the previous \"caretaker\" murdered his wife and daughters. (We also hear, on a TV news bulletin, about a woman who\'s \"disappeared while on a hunting trip with her husband.\") In Full Metal Jacket, the institutionalized misogyny of the Marine Corps is pervasive, and the absence of women (we see only two hookers and a sniper) is so conspicuous it becomes a haunting presence. The film\'s climax is the execution of a fifteen-year-old girl. The requiem in the Sonata Café isn\'t just for Mandy but for all the anonymous, expendable women used and disposed of by men of Harford\'s class throughout the ages.\nFor all his flaunting of his money and professional rank, Bill Harford is ultimately put back in his place as a member of the serving class. Recall how he\'s summoned away from Ziegler\'s party in the same polite but perfunctory manner as his friend Nick, the pianist; like him, Bill is just hired help, the party doctor, called upon to repair (if possible) and cover up (if necessary) human messes like Mandy. When he goes to his patient Lou Nathanson\'s apartment, he\'s met by their housemaid, Rosa, who\'s also dressed in black with a white collar, in a perfectly symmetrical entry hall where every object is in a matched pair. The shot makes the doctor and the maid doubles; they\'re equals here. When Bill tries to infiltrate the orgy, he\'s given away by telltale class markers--he shows up in a taxi rather than a limo, and has a costume rental slip in his pocket. His real status at Somerton, as an outsider and intruder, is spelled out for him the next day when he returns to the estate, only to be dismissed with a terse typed note handed him through the bars of the front gate by a tight-lipped servant. (This isn\'t the only time we see Bill through bars--he has to bribe his way past the grated door at Milich\'s.) When Ziegler finally calls him onto the carpet for his transgressions, he chuckles at Bill\'s refusal of a case of 25-year-old Scotch (Bill drinks Bud from the can), not just because this extravagance would be a trifle to him, but because Bill\'s pretense of integrity is an empty gesture--he\'s already been bought. Bill may be able to buy, bribe, and command his own social inferiors, and he may own Alice, but he\'s Ziegler\'s man.\nAlthough Ziegler has a credible explanation for everything that\'s happened--Harford\'s harassment, Nick Nightingale\'s beating, Mandy\'s death--we don\'t ever really know whether he\'s telling the truth or lying to cover up Mandy\'s murder. The script carefully withholds any conclusive evidence that would let us feel comfortably certain either way. But Ziegler does have suspiciously privileged access to details of the case: \"The door was locked from the inside, the police are happy, end of story! [dismissive lip fart.]\" He also claims to be dropping his façade and coming clean a few too many times to be believed: \"I have to be completely frank,\" \"Bill, please--no games,\" and finally, \"All right, Bill, let\'s... let\'s... let\'s cut the bullshit, all right?\" And notice how he introduces his explanation: \"Suppose I were to tell you...\" [emphasis mine]. He\'s not being \"frank\"; he\'s offering Bill an escape, a plausible, face-saving explanation for the girl\'s death to assuage his unexpectedly agitated conscience. (And it\'s one of the few things that Bill has a hard time buying--watch the way his hand adheres to his cheek and slowly slides off his face as he rises to his feet and walks dazedly across the room, trying to absorb the incredible coincidence Ziegler\'s asking him to swallow.) Ziegler\'s \"no games\" plea notwithstanding, this entire conversation is a game--a gentlemanly back-and-forth of challenges and evasions over a question of life and death, throughout which the two opponents circle each other uneasily around a blood-red billiards table.\nWhen Bill persists in his inquiries, Ziegler loses his temper and resorts to intimidation and threats. He reminds him of their respective ranks as master and man: \"You\'ve been way out of your depth for the last twenty-four hours,\" he growls. Of his fellow revelers at Somerton, he says, \"Who do you think those people were? Those were not ordinary people there. If I told you their names--I\'m not going to tell you their names, but if I did, you might not sleep so well.\" In other words, they\'re \"all the best people,\" the sorts of supremely wealthy and powerful men who can buy and sell \"ordinary\" men like Bill and Nick Nightingale, and fuck or kill women like Mandy and Domino. The \"you might not sleep so well\" is also a veiled warning, and it isn\'t Ziegler\'s last. His final word of advice--\"Life goes on. It always does... until it doesn\'t. But you know that, don\'t you, Bill?\"--proffered with an avuncular, unpleasantly proprietary rub of the shoulders, sounds like a reassurance but masks a threat. (We immediately cut from this to a less friendly warning, the mask placed on Bill\'s pillow.) Bill\'s expression, in the foreground, is by now so tight and working with suppressed and conflicting feelings that it\'s hard to read, but one of those feelings is clearly fear for his life--he looks as though he might burst into tears or hysterical laughter, and when Victor claps those patronizing hands on his shoulders, he flinches. In the end, he chooses to accept Victor\'s explanation not because there\'s any evidence to confirm it, but because it\'s a convenient excuse to back down from the dangers of further investigation. He finally understands that he, too, no less than a hooker or a hired piano player, is expendable.\nSo the questions remain: did Mandy just O.D., or was she murdered? Was Bill\'s jeweled mask left on his pillow by Alice as an accusation, or by Ziegler\'s friends as a third and last warning, a death threat like the horse\'s head in the bed in The Godfather? These are crucial questions, ones that Kubrick deliberately leaves unanswered. And yet most reviewers didn\'t even seem to notice that they were questions, instead automatically projecting their own interpretations onto the story--most assuming that Ziegler was providing redundant exposition, that Mandy\'s death was the coincidence Ziegler claimed it to be, and that Alice put the mask there herself. (Dream Story does not even include the character of Ziegler, or any final confrontation with a member of the secret society, and it also makes it clear that it was the protagonist\'s wife who placed the mask on the bed.) But Kubrick bends over so far backward to preserve these ambiguities that they become glaring, demanding of us that we, like Bill, consciously decide what we\'re going to believe. Bill\'s reaction when he sees the mask in his bed could be interpreted either as shame and relief at having his lies exposed, or as the terrified realization that his wife and daughter could have been murdered in their sleep. When Alice wakes up to Bill\'s sobbing, her expression doesn\'t betray whether she\'s startled to see the mask beside her or already knows it\'s there. When we cut to her the next morning, her eyes swollen and red-rimmed with weeping, we don\'t know whether she\'s crying because her husband almost cheated on her or because he\'s endangered their family. And the final dialogue between Bill and Alice is so vague and allusive (\"What should we do?\" \"Maybe we should be grateful,\") that it could as easily refer to Mandy\'s murder and the implied threat to their lives as to Bill\'s indiscretions. If we choose to believe the former, then the Harfords aren\'t just reconciling over their imagined and attempted infidelities; they\'re agreeing to cover up a crime, to be accomplices after the fact to a homicide.\nThis is the film\'s final test--a projection test, like the ambiguous cartoons with blank word balloons shown to Alex at the end of A Clockwork Orange to determine whether his conditioning has been broken. His lascivious and violent interpretations of the images proves that it has. But has ours? The open-ended narrative forces us to ask ourselves what we\'re really seeing; is Eyes Wide Shut a movie about marriage, sex, and jealousy, or about money, whores, and murder? Before you make up your own mind, consider this: has there ever been a Stanley Kubrick film in which someone didn\'t get killed?\nIn the film\'s upbeat but dissonant denouement, the Harfords have taken their daughter Helena Christmas shopping, but they respond to her wishes only politely, distracted by their own inner children. Like many reviewers, they\'re still wrapped up in psychology and sex, missing the sociological implications of what\'s onscreen. But, as in so much of Kubrick\'s work, the dialogue is misdirection; the real story is being told visually. As poor Helena flits anxiously from one display to the next (already an avid little consumer) every item she fondles associates her with the women who have been exploited and destroyed by her father\'s circle. Helena\'s Christmas list includes a blue baby carriage (like the blue stroller seen twice outside Domino\'s apartment), an oversized teddy bear (next to a rack of tigers like the one on Domino\'s bed) and a Barbie doll (reminiscent of Milich\'s daughter) dressed in a diaphanous angel costume just like the one Helena herself wore in the film\'s first scene. She herself has already become a doll, a thing to be dressed up with cute costumes and accessories. Another toy, conspicuously displayed under a red ring of lights, is called \"The Magic Circle\"; the name is an allusion to the ring of ritual prostitutes at the orgy, and the bright red color of the box recalls the carpet on which they genuflected to the high priest, as well as the felt of the pool table over which Bill made his own bargain with the devil. The subplot with Milich and his daughter is clearly echoed here, in another place of business, as the Harfords also casually pimp their own little angel out to the world of commerce.\nAs Eyes Wide Shut closes, this final exchange between Bill and Alice suggests that all the dark adventures they\'ve confessed (\"whether they were real or only dreams\"), and all the crimes in which they are complicit, have occasioned nothing more than another kinky turn-on, no more enlightening than the flirtations at the ball that inflamed their lovemaking when they got home. For all their incoherent talk about being \"awake\" now, their eyes are still wide shut. Reconciled, they plan to forget all this unpleasantness soon in the blissful oblivion of orgasm. (Try keeping your eyes open during orgasm.) Maybe, in the end, it is a film about sexual obsession after all; about sex as an all-consuming distraction from the ugly realities of wealth and power all around us. Maybe the customer is always wrong.\nCertainly a subtler psychological reading of the film than has yet been attempted would be possible. But to focus exclusively on the Harford\'s unexamined inner lives is to remain willfully blind to the profoundly visual filmic world that Stanley Kubrick devoted a career\'s labors to creating. The slice of that world he tried to show us in his last--and, he believed, his best--work, the capital of the global American empire at the end of the American Century, is one in which the wealthy, powerful, and privileged use the rest of us like throwaway products, covering up their crimes with pretty pictures, shiny surfaces, and murder, ultimately dooming their own children to lives of servitude and whoredom. The feel-good ending intimates, in Kubrick\'s very last word on this (or any) subject, that the Harfords\' daughter is, just as they\'ve resigned themselves to being, fucked.\nAcknowledgements: The seven hundred hours I spent in conversation with Rob Content about this film were invaluable in developing my argument. Bart Taylor of Giotto Perspectives pointed out some of the Christian imagery in the film to me. I am also indebted to Boyd White, guitarist and singer for The Sores, and to Ann Martin, editor of Film Quarterly, for their editorial acumen.
